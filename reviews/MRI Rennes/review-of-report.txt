This is a review of the MRI report titled "Expressiveness of
single-rooted DEL presentations" by Sébastien Lê Cong.

Summary
=======

I will not repeat the purpose of this work since this has not changed
since I wrote the review of the proposal.  Suffice it to remind the
reader that this work is about finding classes of DEL structures for
which epistemic planning is decidable. In order to do this, the work
proposed to understand whether or not a DEL structure is automatic
(automaticity implies decidability of epistemic planning, and more).

This question was hard to tackle head-one. Consequently, the author 
approached it via proxies, i.e., studying the complexity (in language 
theoretic terms) of the trace-language of a DEL structures, and the 
comparing the DEL structure to configuration spaces of resource-bounded 
Turing Machines (i.e., finite automata, pushdown machines, queue automata).

Thm 1 shows how to reduce epistemic planning to the case of
ontic-planning with formulas of modal-depth at most 1.  The idea is to
introduce atoms for the subformulas, and to update these atoms (i.e.,
use them in postconditions), step by step, in order to simulate the
evaluation of the original formulas. The reduction, interestingly,
only translates the event model (and not the epistemic model).

Results about trace-languages:
- the trace languages of DEL structures exhaust the prefix-closed
  regular languages, and co-incide with the propositional DEL
  structures, 
- there is a  context-free non regular language that is not a DEL
  structure (for 1 agent), 
- there is a DEL structure whose trace language is context-sensitive
  but not context-free.  These results are shown by simulating the
  runs of automata, PDA, etc., in the mechanism that generates DEL
  structures.

Results about machine-simulation:
- the configuration space of DFAs, PDAs and Queue automata are isomorphic to DEL structures.
 
Assessment of the Scientific content
====================================

I found this thesis promising. There are novel and interesting
results, and these open up new directions in the study of the
expressive power of DEL.

The authors do not seem aware of the fact that, viewing word-automatic
graphs as language acceptors (with regular sets of initial and final
states, and actions labeling the edges), generates exactly the
context-free languages [DOI: 10.1007/s00236-004-0160-0].  This work
should be discussed and compared with the notion of event traces in
dfn 9.

At any rate, it probably allows one to deduce that the DEL structure
from c) is not word-automatic.

This also suggests one could view DEL structures as language
acceptors: i.e., M,E,\varphi determines the language of all traces h
such that (ME*,h) \models \phi. This would allow one to get rid of the
"prefix-closed" restrictions... For instance, your construction can be
used to show that every regular language (not necc. prefix-closed) is
the generated in this way by a propositional DEL structure.

I wrote in the review of the proposal:
- The definitions of the objects being studied are sometimes formal
  and clear, and other times informal and less clear. Writing clear
  but informal definitions is a skill worth acquiring.

This has definitely improved, although there is still room for
improvement.  e.g., dfns 3 and 4 should be tightened, and dfn 6 should
be rewritten formally.

I wrote:
- I could not get a systematic and clear understanding of what
  theorems/conjectures are to be used as starting points for the
  proposed research. In particular, I would have liked to have seen
  more explicit directions in the prospective methodology.  
  
In contrast, the report has taken on very clear shape. That said, some
proofs are only sketched, e.g., 3.3

The relationship between various notions should be discussed.  e.g.,
the unfolding of every PDA is a DEL-structure, and yet there is
context-free language that is not the trace set of any DEL structure.

One important aspect that is missing from this writeup is a clear 
description of the consequences of the new results for epistemic planning.
e.g., if X is the set of traces generated by a DEL structure and Y is the 
set of traces satisfying a given formula, then epistemic planning reduces 
to checking X \cap Y \neq \emptyset, which may be effective depending on the 
complexities of X and Y (e.g., if X is context-free and Y is regular, 
this check is effective).


Assessment of the Presentation
==============================

I wrote in my first report:
- The survey of existing work is comprehensive but not well organised.
  In fact, it is difficult to parse the text to understand exactly
  what is known. That said, the existing work is itself spread across
  multiple papers with multiple notations.

Although this aspect has definitely improved, there is still much room
for improvement.
e.g., all of 2.3.3
e.g., tables 2 and 3 are missing many citations

Generally speaking, there are aspects of the original proposal that
have not been improved, e.g., whole sections have remained intact,
although they should have been updated, refined, and polished (e.g.,
2.4.1, 2.4.2).

The introduction starts off gently, but too quickly jumps into details
without explaining the meaning (at least intuitively) of terms, esp.
those used in Table 1.

The new work has not been cleanly integrated into the proposal.  e.g.,
I could not see an update on the open problems in DEL (2.4.1) in light
of Theorem 1.

Proofs should be preceeded by careful descriptions of what to expect,
i.e., rough ideas of what the constructions are going to do.


Comments to author
==================
The language has improved wrt the proposal. However, there is still
room for improvement.  e.g., "may well be automatic" is confusing.

Many statements are quite vague. Luckily, sometimes these statements
are followed by more precise statements.  e.g., "Such is the
motivation for pinpointing DEL structures as global objects and
classifying them by finding out a hierarchy; we are also interested in
exploring the interplay between this hierarchy and the Chomsky
hierarchy."

Table 1 includes existing and new results. I suggest emphasising this
difference; perhaps using two tables?  Also, what does the shading
represent?

- 2^{AP}, not 2^AP
- V:{w} \to 2^{AP}
- here you write "single-rooted". later (p13) you write
  "single-pointed".

p13.
- {p_\psi : \psi ...}
- by Theorem .
- The notation for postconditions is not consistent. On pg5 it is
  \mapsto, but later (e.g., pg 13) it is \leftarrow.

p14.
- Proposition 1... you need to define what it means for two DEL
  structures to be isomorphic, especially since they have different
  sets of atoms.

p15. 
run a spell check

p19.
- "Yet (M, w) \not \models pre(a)"... do you mean "\models"?
- caracterises
- any state is final --> every state is final

In the proof of lemma 4 you write: "... ME ∗ be automatic, and in
particular, its event traces form a regular language, while L is not
regular." This seems to say that the set of traces of an automatic
structure is regular.  This is not true.

Moreover, the language in thm 5 looks very similar to the one in thm
4...

p26
what is the example from DT16 used for in that work?  say in words
what the language is, or what the PDA does.

p27.
it is important to work out the details of remark 1.

p28.
- Define "execution tree". Later you write "unfolding of the
  configuration space".
- I could not parse thm 6

p29.
- 4.1: didn't you basically already prove this (for NFAs instead of
  DFAs) earlier?
- what is the relationship between your result here about
  configuration spaces of PDA and the earlier result about traces
  languages of PDA?

p36.
- sometimes you write 0,1 and sometimes 1,0 in the superscript.
