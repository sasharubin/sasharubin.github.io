CONTEXT AND CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------------------
This is a theoretical paper that provides a few logics for reasoning about multiple agents situated in the infinite discrete 2D-grid. 

The motivation for introducing these logics is that the models of classic logics for multi-agent reasoning, such as ATL, are abstract transition systems (or game-structures) with no concrete connection to the spatial environments in which many agents will find themselves, e.g., in real or approximate space. In this sense, the authors' logics are "grounded".

The authors introduce a few logics and study their satisfiability problem, model-checking problem, and axiomatisation problem.  The syntax of the logics have the flavor of propositional dynamic logic (PDL). The models consist of a position for each agent and a set of atoms at each position in the 2D-grid. The most general logic (in which agents can execute programs to sense their environment using unbounded iteration) is undecidable. This leads to restrictions with decidable satisfiability (e.g., disallowing unbounded iteration). The authors also begin the study of extensions that allow the agents to move, that involve epistemic operators (capturing what an agent can see in a fixed-size square neighbourhood around it), and that can express simple strategic properties.

EVALUATION
----------

Pros:
- the paper is superbly(!) written and easy to follow.
- the proofs are neat and to the point.
- the examples are short and illustrative.
- the syntaxes are simple and easy to read.
- the semantics are simple enough to understand, but general enough to be quite expressive.

Cons:
- some of the proofs are not sketched and some detail would be welcome.
- the related work is a bit lite.

COMMENTS FOR CONSIDERATION
--------------------------
- Why is the basic logic interpreted over an infinite frame with infinitely many atoms?
- Why is there no discussion for the lower-bounds on the complexities? are these hard to achieve?
- You use PDL-like syntax. What is the relationship with automata? e.g., can the logics code finite-state agents?
- The relationship with the work [2,15] and http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2772879.2772908 should be more carefully explained. also, the validity problem on the infinite-grid sounds similar to the parameterised model-checking problem studied in those papers.
- What are the limitations of the logics? What useful/interesting/previously-studied properties can they not capture? 

COMMENTS TO IMPROVE THE PRESENTATION
------------------------------------
The organisation could be slightly improved. It seems the main focus of the paper is on validity and axiomatisations. Thus, perhaps section 3 should be called "undecidability of validity", and section 4 on model-checking can move to the end (right now, where it is, it breaks the flow).

Section 3: what sort of object is C? L_{DL-S*} is orginally defined just with 2 arguments, Atm and Agt, not three as you suggest.

Definition of bisimulation: probably the bisimulation notation should mention the set A of programs. indeed,
- the sentence before lemma 5 is confusing. 
- the sentence before lemma 6 is confusing (what are the basic relations?)

Theorem 4: what is the size of a bounded model? why is it o(n^2)? why little o? what about the number of atoms?

Theorem 5:
To apply lindenbaum's lemma as you do it seems you are missing two things.
1. you have to show that the set of derivable formulas is consistent.
2. the axioms and rules of propositional logic, e.g., modus ponens, \neg \neg \phi \iff \phi.
