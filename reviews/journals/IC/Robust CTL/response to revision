Dear authors,

Thank you for taking my comments into account.

Some minor revision is still needed.

regards,
Sasha Rubin (I am not in favour of single-blind reviews).

The paper still needs a proof-read.
e.g., 
pg 11, typo in dfn of conjunction
pg 51, "instead they definite the"-->"instead they define the"?
pg 51, "AllPath operator"-->"$\AllPath$ operator"?

Example 22: please describe in words what the fail transitions represent in this example.

Dfn 14: the colon in the dfn looks odd (i assume it means "and")

I must insist on more precise statements when discussing expressive power.
e.g., Proposition 21 should explicitly mention which class of models are being 
considered for the logics. 
Also, the discussion after prop 21 should be polished.
e.g., "Thus we see that the expressive power of RoCTL* is somewhere between
that of CTL*v and CTL* (without v)" seems to contradict the statement of prop 21.

Related work: Rephrase the sentence "The logic does not appear to be a strict extension of CTL, as [φ] ≥1 is not equivalent to Aφ."
(The relationship between two well-established logics (PCTL and CTL) should not be guessed).

Bib: please update the bib with journals (if these exist), conferences (if these exists), and then technical reports.

Spacing: the package \xspace may be useful for automatically inserting the correct spaces (useful for macros).

I wrote:
Page 23, lemma 47: you have not defined what it means for a tableau to halt.
You wrote:
RESPONSE: Added: We say that a tableau halts if an algorithm can 
determine if it succeeds in finite time.

This definition does not seem sound to me. A tableau is a mathematical structure. The definition seems to suggest that 
an algorithm can accept or reject a single structure, i.e., that it is only every run on a single input.
