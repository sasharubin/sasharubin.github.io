Summary
-------
This paper studies the expressive power of logics on finite graphs with access
to an arbitrary linear order, so called "order-invariant logics".  For standard
logics in computer science (e.g., FO, MSO) access to a linear-order increases
the expressive power of the logic. As the authors state, the theme of the paper
is to characterise order-invariant logics in terms of standard logics on
restricted classes of graphs. This problem is central in descriptive complexity
theory: indeed, characterising <-inv IFP in terms of a logic with effective
syntax is a long-standing open question (here IFP stand for Inflationary
Fixed-Point semantics).

This paper introduces new classes \C of structures, e.g., structures that have tree-decompositions with the following two properties (**):
1. there is a bound on the size of the intersections of the bags,
2. the tree-decompositions and orderings of the bags are definable in CMSO.

Here CMSO is the extension of MSO by modulo-counting predicates (e.g., "there exists an even number of elements such that ...").

Note that \C may have unbounded tree-width.

The main technical result (MTR) establishes that if \C satisfies (**) then order-invariant MSO = Counting MSO on \C (Theorem 3.1). 

As corollaries, the authors show that if \C has bounded tree-width or does not
have K_{3,l} as a minor (for any fixed l) then \C satisfies (**), and thus
<-inv MSO = CMSO on \C (Theorems 5.5 and 5.9).

Partial results are given for <-inv FO, i.e., replace CMSO by MSO in (**) and
replace <-inv MSO = CMSO by <-inv FO is a subset of MSO.


Novelty
-------
The main technical result (MTR) is new. However, whether or not the corollaries regarding graphs of bounded tree-width are new is unclear.

First: the fact that <-inv FO is a subset of MSO on graphs of bounded
tree-width appears in [1, Theorem 5.1]. The authors of the paper under review
seem to have missed this point.

Second: the statement "<-inv MSO = CMSO on graphs of bounded tree-width" was
previously claimed to hold (see [1] and [Lapoire STACS 98]). However, the
authors seem to dispute the proof suggested there. They write: "...as discussed
by Benedikt and Segoufin [1], an approach for proving <-inv-MSO = CMSO and
<-inv-FO \subseteq MSO would be to combine and refine results of Courcelle
[3, 4] with an approach for defining tree decompositions of bounded width using
MSO-transductions, but the latter is not known [8, Section 7.6]." At any rate,
in the rest of this review I will assume that the statement "<-inv MSO = CMSO
on graphs of bounded tw" has not been previously proved in the literature.


Presentation
------------
The quality of the presentation is poor. Some of the notions are needlessly
hard to follow (e.g., the exact definition of A^* is unclear), many of the
technical details are given without intuitions (e.g., 'a-nodes' and 'b-nodes',
A^**), and many of the descriptions use colloquial language that obscures what
is going on. See Comments to Authors for details. 

The related work section is very hard to follow and not detailed enough. 
- The status of the corollary discussed above about <-inv MSO should be dealt with more fully.
There should be a clearer discussion of previous proof attempts of the result that <-inv MSO = CMSO on graphs of bounded tree-width. For instance, the paper "Recognizability Equals Definability for Graphs of Bounded Treewidth and Bounded Chordality" by Bodlaender et al. (Elec. Notes in Disc. Math 2015) states that people in the field do not consider [Lapoire STACS 98] satisfactory.
- The relationship with other work [1,3,4,9] is discussed in the introduction but should be clearer. For instance, "all the results mentioned above" should be removed; what is the relationship with [9] on depth-bounded structures? or with bounded-valence structures of [1]? 
- The discussion starting with "Lifting theorems of this kind can be seen to be implicitly used earlier in [1,3,4]" is important and should be clearer, e.g., what does it mean that "the whole structure can be transformed into an equivalent tree"?. 
- Finally, what is the relationship with "First-order and Monadic Second-Order Model-Checking on Ordered Structures" by Engelmann et al (LICS 2012) that shows that order-invariant MSO is tractable on graphs of bounded tree-width?

There are many ideas and notions which go into the proofs and sometimes the authors do not say which other technical notions have been used elsewhere to similar effect and which are new, e.g., "adhesion", "atoms" (and other notions) appear in [10]; and "segmented", "a-nodes and b-nodes" seem to be new ingredients.


Evaluation
----------
The main technical result (MRT) is new and will certainly interest the LICS
community. The authors demonstrate that the MRT is useful by establishing
corollaries for bounded tree-width graphs and for (a generalisation of) planar
graphs. I suspect that the proof ideas will have relevance beyond this paper.
However, because of the poor presentation, the general LICS reader (such as
myself) will not find this paper rewarding --- it is hard to follow and hard to
understand where the technical novelty lies. 

Comments to Authors
-------------------

General:
There are many minor problems, e.g., typos and missing text. Below I identify some of these, as well as some of the more serious problems.

Introduction
- The sentence "The corresponding theorems show that..." should be improved, e.g., "corresponding" to what? 
- Please give a reference for "type-composition" methods, in particular for "the type-composition methods that are commonly used for the case of bounded size bags".

Section 2.1
- The notion vw for edges should be introduced.
- The notation T[X] should be defined the first time it is used.
- "adhesion" is not a new notion. please give a reference to it.

Section 2.2
- "by using quantifier for counting". Do you mean using "generalised quantifiers"?

Section 2.3
- "modulo-counting quantifiers" (add 's').

Proof of Lemma 2.1
- In (2)-->(1) the definition of \theta is missing "q" and "MSO".

Section 2.4
- "paper it suffices to assume that these free variables"
- You should say that the free variables are element variables and not second-order variables. The latter gives a different (more general) notion of logical interpretation.
- Replace B_{\Lambda[A]} by U_{\Lambda[A]}
- I think it is clearer to write ${\lambda_U}[A]$ instead of $U_{\Lambda[A]}$ (and the same for the relations). Indeed, \lambda_U[A] suggests applying the formula \lambda_U to A.

- "formally stated by". Some text is missing.
- "linear transductions" are mentioned here in a way that makes it sound like
  we should know what they are or that they were already mentioned. Also, since
this is a central notion in the paper, a brief description is required.

Section 3
- The reason you call these "Lifting theorems" only becomes clearer in the proofs. Perhaps a better name is warranted.
- The definition of A^* is not completely clear. What is the universe of A^*? Is it the disjoint union of U(A) and V(T^A)? Or is A^* a two-sorted structure? 
- "on a class \C of \tau-structures" (add 's').
- "We prove the following lemmas"--> "... theorems". 

Section 3.1 to 3.4
I found these sections very hard to follow. Many notions lack intuitive explanations, e.g., "segmented", "a-nodes", "b-nodes", "A^**".
- A^** is mentioned before it is defined (perhaps this is a typo and A^** should be A^*).
- Lemma 3.4 is a composition theorem ala Shelah/Gurevich/Feferman-Vaught. You should reference related composition theorems (if any), and explain Lemma 3.4 informally.
- Ditto for Lemma 3.5, 3.6, 3.7.
- Is the construction of \psi in Section 3.4 effective? How does this relate to
  the result in "First-order and Monadic Second-Order Model-Checking on Ordered
Structures" by Engelmann et al (LICS 2012) mentioned above?

Section 4
- The description of the contents of this section is unclear, esp. the sentence "The goal of this section...". State that Lemma 4.1 is the main result of this section.

Section 4.1
- "output vocabulary" is used but not defined.
- Here, again, the definition of A^* is not clear. A^* can't be the output of a transduction because such outputs have a single domain of the form U(A) \times [w].

Section 4.2. 
This section should be re-organised and rewritten. Mainly, the flow of the proof of Lemma 4.1 is obscure. Here are some other minor points:

- "tree extensions into atoms" is used before it is defined/described.
- In dfn of 'separator' you mean to take x \neq y.
- Lemma 4.1: be-->by
- The following phrases are too colloquial, which in some cases obscures what is meant: "properly defining", "transduction moves from", "we cover how these properties are MSO-definable".
- "In section 4.1 we explain in detail how ...". Section 4.1 already appeared and did not explain this.

Section 5
- GSO is undefined.
- "bounded tree width" should be "bounded tree-width".
- "...a helpful ordering method in the case of an additional bounded separability". The meaning of this sentence is unclear.
- "constant tree width" --> "bounded tree-width"
- "are atoms" (add 's').
- Menger's Theorem is mentioned but not described or referenced.

Appendix
- Using the words "speak" and "speaking" is confusing. I suggest simply saying that "a formula is over a given vocabulary".
- The definition of linear transduction should be cleaned. I assume this notion is analogous to k-copying transduction of Courcelle for graphs [8]. In which case, 
the universe should be U(A) \times [w], and the levels of the elements in \bar{a} in R^i_{\Lambda[A]} should depend on $j$ (as in Section 4.1, par 6).
- Pg 12, column 2: "proof of lemma 2.1" (lemma 2.1 was already proved).


<<<<<<<<<<Confidential Remarks>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The paucity of the related-work and lack of intuitions explaining the main
technical result make it hard to judge what is really new and useful in this
paper. If the paper were better presented, and the related work greatly
expanded, my impression might be different because there seem to be some
interesting ideas here.
