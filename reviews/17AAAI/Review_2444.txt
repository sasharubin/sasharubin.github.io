This paper is about approximating formulas of ATL_ir (imperfect information and
imperfect recall) by formulas of AE\muC (the next-time fragment of ATL_ir with
fixpoints).

In ATL_{Ir} (perfect-information, imperfect recall), formulas have fixpoint
characterisations, e.g., "<<A>>_Ir \eventually \phi" is equivalent to 
"\mu Z. \phi \vee <A>Z".

It is known (Bulling and Jamroga 2014) that these fixpoint characterisations
fail for ATL_ir.  The advantage of having fixpoint formulas is that they are
relatively easy to implement (e.g., they don't rely on sophisticated
automata-theoretic techniques).

This paper provides translations tr(.) and TR(.) of ATL_ir formulas into AE\muC
formulas such that
a) tr(\phi) logically implies \phi (lower-approximation),
b) \phi logically implies TR(\phi) (upper-approximation).

The upper-approximation simply replaces imperfect-information by
perfect-information (thus <<A>>_ir is replaced by <<A>>_Ir which is then
replaced by its fixpoint characterisation).

The lower-bound is more interesting and, e.g., tr(<<A>>_ir \eventually \phi) has
the form "\mu Z. (E_A tr(\phi) \vee <A>^bullet Z)" where <A>^bullet is a new
operator called the "steadfast next step operator".

The papers evaluates the usefuleness of the approximations by solving endplay in
Bridge. The experiments were promising in two directions: accuracy (the
approximations are exact on all or a majority of the instances considered) 
and performance (the approximations could be computed for systems with 
millions of states, while MCMAS could handle only hundreds of states).

I have concerns about the stated justifications, the methodology, the
usefullness/generalisability of this work, and the presentation.

1. The paper makes a number of assumptions that are neither discussed nor justified. 

1a. Why does the paper focus imperfect-recall and not perfect-recall? i.e., on
ATL_ir and not ATL_iR? Approximations might be equally useful for ATL_iR.

1b. The experiments model a bridge-scenario. The authors write "Each player
remembers the cards that have already been played, including the ones that were
used up before the initial state of the k-endplay". This seems to suggest (there
is no supplemental material with the formal definitions of the model, so I can't
be sure), that the state of the iCGS stores the history of the play. If yes,
then isn't the example really one of perfect-recall? and if no, then the
example is not realistic.

2. The paper claims, both explicitly and implicitly, see (X), that there are no
fixpoint equivalences for <<A>>_ir \eventually, etc.  The only justification
offered for this claim is the paper (Bulling and Jamroga 2014). However, that paper 
does not support the claim.  What the cited paper does show is that the *standard*
equivalences (that work for ATL_Ir) do not work for ATL_ir. The cited paper does
not show that there are no translations of formulas of the form "<<A>>_ir
\eventually \phi" into equivalent formulas of AE\muC. Thus, the state of knowledge
is better described by "No fixpoint equivalences are known".

3. Since no fixpoint equivalences are known, the authors' main job is to justify
the approximations they suggest. Such justifications can come in three flavours:
theoretical, intuitive, or empirical. The authors provide no theoretical
justification in this paper (e.g., by finding a natural class of systems for
which their approximations are exact). The authors spend a few sentences giving
intuitive justifications for their lower-bounds, but I found these lacking
substance. Finally, the authors provide an empirical justification by modeling
endplay of bridge and checking the formula "<<S>>_ir \eventually win" where "S"
is a single-player.  I have the following concerns about this experiment.

3a. The full power of ATL is not illustrated in the example. Indeed:
- since are only a finite number of tricks to play, the duration of each play
  is, for practical purposes, finite. On the other hand ATL can talk about plays
  of infinite duration.
- the formula considered has a very simple form, i.e., no nesting of strategic
  operators (and thus this is a form of synthesis), and quantification over a
  single agent.

3b. In the main experiment (figure 5) the approximations were exact. Why is
this? No intuitive or theoretical justification is given. 

Also, this means, in particular, that the formulas "<<S>>_ir \eventually win"
and "<<S>>_Ir \eventually win" are equivalent on the models considered (i.e.,
one can assume the agent S has perfect information). Perhaps this is easy to
prove (without the details, I can't tell whether this is easy or not)? If it is easy,
then there is no need for the lower-approximation.

Having said that, the second experiment (figure 6) does not have this drawback.
On the other hand, it is less realistic. Perhaps a security scenario would be more 
appropriate.

4. A note on presentation.

4a. None of the new theoretical results (except Theorem 8) are stated precisely. 
- \phi appears in propositions 3,4,5,6 and theorem 7. However it is not stated
  what logic \phi is from. I assume ATL_ir.
- proposition 3 uses the construct "M,q \models X does not universally imply M,q
  \models Y". The phrase "universally imply" is neither standard nor defined in
  the paper (although it is not hard to guess what is meant, theorems,
  propositions, etc. should be unambiguous).

4b.  The paper (Bulling and Jamroga 2014) is cited a number of times, and at least
two of those times the citation does not say where in the paper one should look to
find the cited results. i.e., 
- "Moreover, the imperfect information semantics of ATL does not admit fixpoint
  equivalences (Bulling and Jamroga 2014)"
- "Unfortunately, this translation provides neither a lower nor an upper bound,
  cf. the counterexamples in (Bulling and Jamroga 2014)."

(X)
- Pg 3: "Unfortunately, the expressivity results imply that there is no fixpoint
  translation that captures exactly the meaning of ATL_ir operators."
- Pg 1: "Moreover, the imperfect information semantics of ATL does not admit
  fixpoint equivalences (Bulling and Jamroga 2014)."
- Pg 3 "At the same time, the analogous variant of Î¼-calculus for imperfect
  information has incomparable expressive power to ATL_ir (Bulling and Jamroga
  2011), which means that, under imperfect information, ATL and fixpoint
  specifications provide an inherently different view of ability."


---
- The fact that citations are given very loosely is either lazy (best case) or
  purposefully wasting reviewer time (worst case).
- Is the second half of proposition 3 correct?
