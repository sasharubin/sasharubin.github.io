OBJECTIVES
Strategic reasoning is one of the most active research areas in
multi-agent system domain. The literature in this field is extensive
and provides a plethora of logics for modelling strategic ability.
Theoretical results are now being used in many exciting domains,
including software tools for information system security, robot teams
with sophisticated adaptive strategies, and automatic players capable
of beating expert human adversaries, just to cite a few. All these
examples share the challenge of developing novel theories and tools
for agent-based reasoning that take into account the likely behaviour
of adversaries. The SR international workshop aims to bring together
researchers working on different aspects of strategic reasoning in
computer science, both from a theoretical and a practical point of
view.

LIST OF TOPICS

The topics covered by the workshop include, but are not limited to, the following:

    Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities;
    Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis;
    Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems;
    Strategic reasoning in formal verification;
    Automata theory for strategy synthesis;
    Strategic reasoning under perfect and imperfect information;
    Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning;
    Robust planning and optimisation in multi-agent systems;
    Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems;
    Quantitative aspects in strategic reasonings.


SUBMISSION

Extended abstracts should be submitted not exceeding 10 pages (plus references) in the EPTCS format. 
If necessary, the work may be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be consulted 
at the discretion of the program committee. Submissions must be in PDF format and will be handled 
via EasyChair.
