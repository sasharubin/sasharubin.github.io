Dear XXX,

We have the great pleasure to invite you to be a Program Committee member for
the 32nd Italian Conference on Computational Logic CILC 2017
(http://cilc2017.unina.it/) to be held in Naples on September 26-29, 2017.

As a PC member your tasks will be to:

- review papers:

We expect that each PC member will handle the review of no more than 3
papers. Providing thorough and professional reviews is crucial for the overall
program quality.

- participate in discussions:

Once papers are reviewed, you will participate in discussions with the other
reviewers to try and reach agreements on the strong and weak points of the
papers, and suggest a decision (accept or reject) that will be forwarded to the
chairs.

We hope that you accept this invitation to work towards the success of CILC
2017.

sincerely,
Dario Della Monica <dario.dellamonica@unina.it>, Aniello Murano <murano@unina.it>, and Luigi Sauro (co-chairs)
