Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

We have the great pleasure to invite you to be a Program Committee
member for the 18th Italian Conference on Theoretical Computer Science
ICTCS 2017 (ictcs2017.unina.it) to be held in Naples on September
26-29, 2017. 

As a PC member your tasks will be to:

- review papers:

We expect that each PC member will handle the review of about 5
papers. Providing thorough and professional reviews is crucial for the
overall program quality.

- participate in discussions:

Once papers are reviewed, you will participate in discussions with the
other reviewers to try and reach agreements on the strong and weak
points of the papers, and suggest a decision (accept or reject) that
will be forwarded to the chairs.

We hope that you accept this invitation to work towards the success 
of ICTCS 2017.

sincerely,
Aniello Murano <murano@unina.it> and Sasha Rubin <rubin@unina.it> (co-chairs)
