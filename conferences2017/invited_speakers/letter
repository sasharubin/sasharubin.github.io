Dear X,

I am writing about the conferences ICTCS 2017 and CILC 2017 to be held
as a joint event in Napoli this year, 26-29 September.

We would be honoured if you would agree to be an invited speaker for the
joint event.

The aim is to bring together researchers working on different aspects of 
logics and theoretical computer science, both from a theoretical and a 
practical point of view.

For more information about the two conferences please see

We would be delighted to hear you talk about XXX, although, of course, feel 
free to choose any topic.

We are confident that your contribution would be well received and appreciated
by both communities, and will contribute to a successful edition this year.

Sincerely,

Aniello Murano (general chair of CILC and co-chair of ICTCS)
Dario Della Monica (co-chair of CILC)
Sasha Rubin (co-chair of ICTCS)
Luigi Sauro (co-chair of CILC)
