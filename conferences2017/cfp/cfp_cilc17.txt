                        CALL FOR PAPERS

                    32nd Italian Conference on
                       Computational Logic

            (CILC 2017) -- http://cilc2017.unina.it/

               Naples, Italy, September 26-29, 2017

**********************************************************************

CILC (Italian Conference on Computational Logic) is the annual conference
organized by GULP (Group of researchers and Users of Logic Programming,
www.programmazionelogica.it). Its 32nd edition will be held in Naples (Italy) on
September 26-29, 2017.

Since the first event of the series, which took place in Genoa in 1986, the
annual GULP conference represents the main opportunity for users, researchers
and developers working in the field of computational logic to meet and exchange
ideas. Over the years the conference broadened its horizons from the specific
field of logic programming to include declarative programming and applications
in neighboring areas such as artificial intelligence and deductive databases.

CILC 2017 is co-located with the 18th Italian Conference on Theoretical Computer
Science ICTCS 2017 (http://ictcs2017.unina.it/) with which it will share part of
the program. The two events will feature plenary events, on September 29, to be
specified later.


Contributions:
--------------
The conference will feature presentations of refereed contributions, including
the demonstration of software prototypes, concerning all aspects of
computational logic.

The conference invites two types of submissions: full papers, possibly already
submitted to other conferences or journals, and short papers, which are
particularly suitable for presenting work in progress, software prototypes,
extended abstracts of doctoral theses, or general overviews of research
projects.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

  Logic Programming, Constraint Programming and other paradigms of declarative programming
  Extensions and integrations of declarative programming paradigms
  Analysis, transformation, validation, and verification of programs
  Instruments and environments for program development
  Implementations and benchmarking
  Model Checking
  Temporal logics
  Automated Theorem Proving
  Non-Monotonic Reasoning
  Answer Set Programming
  Knowledge representation and extraction
  Treatment of uncertain and incomplete knowledge
  Approximate Reasoning
  Abductive Logic Programming
  Model-based Reasoning
  Inductive Logic Programming
  Deductive Databases
  Data Mining and Data Integration
  Multi-agent systems
  Logics for strategic reasoning
  Semantic Web
  Natural Language Processing
  Computational logic for concurrency, coordination, mobility and objects
  Planning and scheduling
  Probabilistic Logic Programming
  Computational Logic and formal methods in Artificial Intelligence
  Applications of Computational Logic
  Pedagogy of Computational Logic


Important dates:
----------------
Abstract, paper, and demo submission deadline: 25 May 2017
Notification of acceptance: 30 June 2017
Final version and early registration deadline: 24 July 2017
Conference: 26-29 September 2017


Submission instructions:
------------------------
Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts in PDF via the EasyChair system
at the link:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cilc2017

Articles must not exceed 15 pages for full papers and 5 pages for short papers,
respectively. Manuscripts should be formatted using the Springer LNCS style. To
ease the reviewing process, the authors of regular papers may add an appendix
(although reviewers are not required to consider it in their evaluation). All
contributions must be written in English.

In particular, we invite submissions of system or prototype software
descriptions which use techniques or tools of computational logic, or which
themselves aid the development of applications based on computational
logic. Systems of both research and industrial character are
welcome. Submissions must include a brief description, prepared according to the
guidelines given for short papers, and a specification of the required hardware
and software equipment.

For each accepted contribution, at least one of the authors is required to
attend the conference and present the paper. The event is organized by
GULP. Therefore, Italian attendants are required to be members of GULP (it is
possible to join GULP at the conference).


Proceedings:
------------
Papers accepted for presentation at the conference (both full and short) will be
published on CEUR-WS.org.

As in previous years, we plan to publish a selection of the best papers in a
special issue of an international journal (to be determined).
