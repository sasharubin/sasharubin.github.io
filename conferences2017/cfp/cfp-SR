   5th International Workshop on Strategic Reasoning
       SR 2017 -- http://sr2017.csc.liv.ac.uk/
           Liverpool, UK, July 26-27, 2017
********************************************************
 
Strategic reasoning is one of the most active research areas in the
multi-agent system domain. The literature in this field is extensive
and provides a plethora of logics for modelling strategic ability.
Theoretical results are now being used in many exciting domains,
including software tools for information system security, robot teams
with sophisticated adaptive strategies, and automatic players capable
of beating expert human adversaries, just to cite a few. All these
examples share the challenge of developing novel theories and tools
for agent-based reasoning that take into account the likely behaviour
of adversaries. The international workshop on strategic reasoning aims
to bring together researchers working on different aspects of strategic
reasoning in computer science, both from a theoretical and a practical
point of view.
 
SR 2017 will be co-located with TARK 2017, which will be held in Liverpool
on July 24-26, 2017.
 
LIST OF TOPICS
 
The topics covered by the workshop include, but are not limited to,
the following:
 
     Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities;
     Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis;
     Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems;
     Strategic reasoning in formal verification;
     Automata theory for strategy synthesis;
     Strategic reasoning under perfect and imperfect information;
     Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning;
     Robust planning and optimisation in multi-agent systems;
     Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems;
     Quantitative aspects in strategic reasonings.
 
 
SUBMISSION
 
Extended abstracts should be submitted not exceeding 10 pages (plus
references) in the EPTCS format.  If necessary, the work may be
supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be consulted
at the discretion of the program committee. Submissions must be in PDF
format and will be handled via EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2017
 
Two types of submission are invited:
 
     contributions reporting on novel research;
     expository contributions reporting on published work.
 
Each submission should be clearly identified as belonging to one
category or the other.  In both categories, strong preference will be
given to papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary
audience and all contributions should be written so that they are
accessible to such an audience.
 
Novel research abstracts will be held to the usual high standards of
research publications.  In particular, they should contain enough
information to enable the program committee to identify the main
contribution of the work, explain the significance of the work, its
novelty, its relevance to the strategic reasoning audience, and its
practical or theoretical implications, and include comparisons with
and references to relevant literature.
 
Expository abstracts, which will be evaluated using similar high
standards, may survey an area or report on more specific previously
published work.
 
Submissions from PC members are also allowed. Note that, since the
workshop will have informal proceedings, extended versions of the
accepted papers can also be submitted elsewhere.
