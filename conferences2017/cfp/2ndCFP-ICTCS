**********************************************************************

The Italian Conference on Theoretical Computer Science (ICTCS) is the
conference of the Italian Chapter of the European Association for
Theoretical Computer Science. ICTCS 2017 is the 18th edition of ICTCS
and will take place in Naples, September 26-29, 2017. 

The purpose of the meeting is to foster the cross-fertilization of
ideas stemming from different areas of theoretical computer science.
In particular, it provides an ideal environment where junior
researchers and PhD students can meet senior researchers.

ICTCS 2017 is co-located with the 32nd Italian Conference on
Computational Logic CILC 2017 (http://cilc2017.unina.it/) with which
it will share part of the program. The two events will feature plenary
events, on September 29, to be specified later.

-------------
Contributions in any area of theoretical computer science are warmly
solicited from researchers of all nationalities.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

agents, algorithms, argumentation, automata theory, automated theorem
proving, complexity theory, computational logic, computational social
choice, concurrency, cryptography, discrete mathematics, distributed
computing, dynamical systems, formal methods, game theory, graph
theory, knowledge representation languages, model checking,
multi-agent systems, process algebras, quantum computing, rewriting
systems, security and trust, semantics, specification and
verification, systems biology, type theory

Important dates:
----------------
Abstract and paper submission deadline: 25 May 2017

Notification of acceptance: 30 June 2017

Final version and early registration deadline: 24 July 2017

Conference: 26-29 September 2017

Submissions:
------------
Two types of contributions are solicited.

Regular papers: up to 12 pages in LNCS style. Full original papers,
presenting novel results, not appeared or submitted elsewhere.

Communications: up to 5 pages in LNCS style. Suitable for extended
abstracts of papers already appeared, or submitted, or to be
submitted, elsewhere; papers reporting ongoing research on which
the authors wish to get feedback at ICTCS; overviews of PhD-theses, 
research projects, etc...

To ease the reviewing process, the authors of regular papers may add 
an appendix (although reviewers are not required to consider it in 
their evaluation). All contributions must be written in English.

Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts in PDF via EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictcs20172

For each accepted contribution, at least one of the authors is
required to attend the conference and present the paper.

Proceedings:
------------
All accepted original contributions (communications and regular
papers) will be published on CEUR-WS.org.

Non-original communications will be given visibility on the conference
web site including a link to the original publication if already
published.

As in previous years, we plan to publish a selection of the best
papers in a special issue of an international journal (to be
determined). This is open to regular papers as well as communication
papers that have not been published in a journal. 

Venue:
------
The conference will take place at the "Complesso di San Giovanni a
Teduccio---Complesso Napoli Est", in Corso Nicolangelo Protopisani,
70, 80146 Napoli.
