**TODO**

1. Dear ICTCS organizers,

I have submitted a paper (number 34) to ICTCS 2017. Because of its nature, this paper would have been more adapt for a conference such as CILC 2017, instead; since Dr. Della Monica is among its authors, we decided to submit it to ICTCS in order to comply with the policy of the conference (Dario is a co-chair of CILC 2017). In case of acceptance, then, I would like to kindly ask you to include our paper in the common session that, I understand, will be organized between the two sessions. The common session will have audience from the logical community as well, we hope, who will more likely appreciate the objective of the research in this paper. 

Thank  you in advance.

Guido Sciavicco
(on behalf of the other authors of paper number 34)
