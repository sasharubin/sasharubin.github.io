ANU Summer School in Logic, December 2-13, 2019

What: The annual ANU summer school in logic consists of short courses on
aspects of pure and applied logic. The first week consists of foundational
material, and the second week on applications. 

Who: Participants are typically a broad mix of undergrads (mostly from computer
science, but also from mathematics and philosophy) and some postgrads.
Participants should have some basic knowledge of logic.  All courses aim to
give a bird's eye view of the topic. 

Where: ANU, Acton Campus

When: December 2-13, 2019

Why Logic: Logic has been called "the calculus of computer science" since it
plays a fundamental role in computer science similar to the role that calculus
has in engineering. For instance, logic appears in architecture (logic gates),
software engineering (specification and verification), programming languages
(semantics, logic programming), databases (relational algebra and SQL),
artificial intelligence (automatic theorem proving, knowledge representation,
symbolic AI), algorithms (complexity and expressiveness), and theory of
computation (general notions of computability).

One of the lecturers this year is Sasha Rubin. He leads the Computational
Logic for Artificial Intelligence (LOGIC-AI) group in the School of Computer
Science at the University of Sydney. Feel free to contact him for more
