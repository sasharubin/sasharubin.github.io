This course is intended for graduate students who have taken basic
courses in discrete mathematics, data structures, logic and
computation and who want to add to their toolbox a versatile tool for
reasoning about dynamic systems.

1. Algorithmic Foundations: Decision problems, Automata theory

 Decision problems, Finite Automata, Regular expressions, Automata on
 infinite words, Automata on infinite trees


2. Foundations: Logics for Verification

 What are logics? Syntax, Semantics.

 What are logics good for? model checking, satisfiability, realisability.
 
 Modal logics for multi-agent systems: modal logic, epistemic operators,
 temporal operators, strategic operators
