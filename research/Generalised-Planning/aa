Dear Michael,

I am writing to invite you to give a distinguished invited talk at an informal
meeting we are holding in Naples, February 22-24, 2017, on the topic "Formal
methods in AI".

The purpose of the meeting is three-fold:
- To share ideas about how formal methods have been and will be useful in AI.
- To discuss strategies for bringing the Formal Methods and AI communities
  closer together.
- To consolidate collaborations and form new ones.

Confirmed senior participants include Hector Geffner, Diego Calvanese, Giuseppe
de Giacomo, and Sophie Pinchinat.

Many of the participants have a background in formal methods, i.e., logics for
strategic and epistemic reasoning for multi-agent systems, theory of automata
and games, etc.

We would welcome a talk at the interface between formal methods and autonomous
systems.

We intend to cover all your costs and would be honoured if you accept,

sincerely,
Sasha Rubin
