Strategy Logic (\SL) is a logical formalism for strategic reasoning in
multi-agent systems that generalises most proposals, including \ATLS. 
It's main feature is that it has variables for pure
strategies.  Motivated by the fact that the canonical strategies in game-theory are randomised (i.e., mixed), we generalise \SL by allowing variables to vary over
randomised strategies. The resulting \emph{strategy-logic with randomised strategies}, \SLR, can express many standard solution concepts, include Nash Equilibria, Subgame-Perfect Equilibria, and Secure Equilibria. We study the model-checking and satisfiability problems for \SLR.
