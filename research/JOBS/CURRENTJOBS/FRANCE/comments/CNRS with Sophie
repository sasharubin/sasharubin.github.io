CRNS with Sophie

Notes from 24 luglio 2017

- given time constraint, show continuity with what i can do (rather than delve into a new field)
- higlight what you have achieved, that you are open minded, mobile, and made non-trivial contributions to important domains.

research plan
- give believable midterm project/plan that is convincing.
- since joining a group, the plan should align (check this). perhaps bridge KR + BMP group with FM group at INRIA.
- be daring, be creative.
- show you know the right people, and you know the right material.
- give strong methodology that convinces people a) you can do this, b) you will make significant steps
- maturity is expected... i.e., don't over- or under-promise on speed or how much can be done; show experience can now pick/choose right problems. 
- these problems should be SOCIALLY RELEVANT. show how to bring FM into this.
- demonstrate using FM for problems has worked in the past. e.g., synthesis? see Raskin, Tom's ERC etc.
- end goal is to develop tools.  
- technical content should already be mastered. show this.
- motivate from CONCRETE
- show address a GAP
- show



Notes from Sept 2017

LOGICA
Doing only theory is fine. But better to have application in mind and something TO SHOW, e.g., demo!
TRY TO MAKE THINGS VISIBLE.

This should help getting grants/WP on real projects.

(Deadline for written app is, it seems, Jan; interview a few months later, decision by april?)

e.g., multi robots, central control, discrete graph, discrete communication structure, exploration + communication lines 
stay connected + keep battery powered.

GOAL:
exhibit theoretical problems st that 
1) motivated by concrete applications
2) not obvious to solve

Bridge communities

IRISA
many good teams to work with, 
e.g., robotics, e.g., great SE team


cf LSV that did theory of energy games with application in mind.
but they never built a demo of the application (it seems).

NEXT STEPS:
- send SP/FS an email that elaborates on i) what we can achieve with LOGICA (as a CNRS), and ii) how I would fit there
