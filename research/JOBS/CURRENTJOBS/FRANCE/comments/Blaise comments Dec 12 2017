too much in the past
too much of your own stuff and not enough of importance of other stuff (same level as my stuff)., senior! show you know the field.

[humble is important...  give them enough information so they conclude the stuff is good]

show what type of researcher you are, early.

start/first page should be very high level; don't talk about technical details here.

cite people who you are going to work with to attack challenges

what are the big level strategies to meet challenges

details are fine, come later, simply to show you know what you are talking about

focus of this project: say new classes are meaningful

mid term - show direction
imagine you have millions of euros, what would you achieve after 10 years.(!) what is end result?
helps them to remember your ideas; give them reasons to hire you.
show what you will be a leader in, towards the ultimate end (of FM for AA).

what is in the middle? match applications to models/classes of interest; 
show can translate applications to scientific goals. show you can/have do this.
