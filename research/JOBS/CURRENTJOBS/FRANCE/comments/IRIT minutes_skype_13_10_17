Skype
- no CR1, CR2, only CR and DR... apply for CR
- committee is heavily biased to TCS. being inbetween AI and TCS is an advantage.

- other teams: LILAC, MELODY (language), ADRIA (possibility logic, Dubois), ACADI (verification using proof assistants)

- connection with planning important! see gossip protocol paper (blocks-world for epistemic planning). people in ADRIA 
group do some planning (Martin cooper does temporal planning).
