      

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to apply for the faculty position advertised on the DEI
website:
https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/departamentos/dei/procura-aberta-de-docentes--open-faculty-search-ad9

My research interests are in formal methods for multi-agent systems,
and as such would nicely complement the work of Ana Paiva's group on
intelligent and multi-agent systems. I also expect some mutual
interests with the Embedded Electronic Systems Lab headed by InÃªs
Lynce, and the SW Algorithms and Tools for Constraint Solving group in
particular.

I have previously held a New Zealand Science and Technology
Postdoctoral Fellowship, and am currently a Marie-Curie fellow of the
Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica in Italy.

I am an active PC member, most recently for AAAI 2017 and IJCAI 2017. 
I have organised a number of workshops, most recently the First Workshop on
Formal Methods in Artificial Intelligence (FMAI) 2017, in Naples.

I am passionate about teaching well, and regularly self-evaluate my teaching.

Finally, on a personal note, my wife is fluent in Portuguese, and I
have learned some basics from her and from travelling in Brasil in 2006.

I attach a zip file containing my CV, Teaching Statement, and Research
Statement. The CV contains the names and email addresses of academics
that have agreed to provide reference letters. Since the call asked 
for three name, I suggest:
- Aniello Murano (my current host) who can attest to my scientific and 
professional service.
- Giuseppe De Giacomo (a recent collaborator) who can attest to my 
scientific depth and breadth.
- Maria Terrell who can attest to my passion and commitment to pedagogy.

sincerely,
Sasha
