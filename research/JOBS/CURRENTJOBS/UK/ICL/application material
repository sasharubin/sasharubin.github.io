==========================================================================


I taught three semesters of Calculus for Engineers at Cornell
University, essentially a second course in calculus for first year
students that follows a textbook very closely. After each lecture I
reflected on how I could improve presentation of the material. This
usually involved improving the pace, refining what to write on the
board, and finding better ways to break up the material into chunks
that students could follow. My students were generally capable of
acquiring, on their own, the skills to work routine problems.
Consequently my main goal was to get them to reason mathematically,
both verbally and in writing.  I noticed that students are very
sensitive to the wording I use. I kept a list of phrases to which they
seem to respond, such as ‘can anyone help A with her answer?’, ‘can
you explain B’s idea to me?’, ‘what do you mean by X?’, ‘are you
sure?’, ‘who will summarise today’s class?’, ‘if all I do is teach you
computational procedures I’m short-changing you’.

I worked hard finding angles on the material that would engage my
students. This invariably involved finding a question that sounded fun
to try to solve. My favourite moments in class were those that
involved discussing the big ideas in calculus. After writing a theorem
on the board I asked: ‘why should we believe this?’ (a soft version of
‘how do we prove it?’) and the often overlooked ‘how is this theorem
useful?’.

I also learned to ask questions that probe student knowledge and
understanding. For instance ‘why would you say that?’ and ‘tell me
more’ helps to diagnose their logic, and asking easy recall-level
questions let me see whether students had been listening.

Although my students were most comfortable with being given algorithms
to solve problems I instead focused on problem solving techniques ala
Pólya: 1) identify the unknown, 2) if you can’t solve the problem find
a problem that you can solve that has a similar unknown.  I
experimented with small group work in class to alter the pacing of
lectures and encouraged my students to think and reflect on what they
had and had not understood.

Here is some student feedback from that course:

- Sasha was a wonderful lecturer -- very organized, clear, and willing
  to help anyone with difficulties (proactively, as well -- he sought
  out people who were doing poorly and offered assistance, which was
  extremely beneficial).

- The class was interesting, fun, and easier. Professor was very well
  prepared and made us really understand what we were learning by
  having us write mathematical formulas in words. Instead of
  memorizing formulas, he helped us understand what we were learning,
  why we were learning it and why it was useful.

Early in 2010 I designed, taught and administered the undergraduate
course on logic and computation in the mathematics department at the
University of Cape Town. Student abilities in the class were very
mixed which meant I had to structure the course and pace very
carefully. I slowed the lectures down a bit and moved harder questions
to the tutorials. One of the strongest students sent me an email at
the end of the term:

- I have enjoyed your maths course the most of all the maths courses
I’ve taken so far at UCT. Even more than the content, your delivery
was excellent... I made the decision during one of your lectures to
do honours in mathematics and computer science next year at UCT.
Example experience – Technical University of Vienna

In 2017 I designed and taught an advanced course “Milestones in
Solving Games on Graphs” at the Technical University of Vienna (2017).
The course attracted a mix of advanced undergraduates, Msc students,
and PhD students. The course started from first principles, included
many motivating examples, and also included lectures on my own
recently published research.  Here are some student comments:

- I especially liked the fact that you let us engage with the ideas.
  I think I was able to deepen my understanding of graph games a lot
  because I never took an actual course in it.

- During the lecture Sasha Rubin promotes logically and mathematically
  rigorous thinking and achieves a rare level of engagement among the
  students.  This combination results in a very enjoyable and
  stimulating course.

“Verification of Broadcasting Multi-Agent Systems against an Epistemic Strategy Logic”. 
In: International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2017). 2017.

SUMMARY: In this paper we exhibit a very general and meaningful class of multi-agent 
systems with imperfect information in which model-checking very expressive logics is 
decidable. Indeed, a system is in the class if all agents communicate by broadcasting 
messages, and the logic allows one to express whether or not the system exhibits a 
Nash Equilibrium, a fundamental concept in game-theory and for the analysis of behaviour 
of agents. All previous results on model-checking such a rich logic relied on orthogonal 
assumptions which are far less applicable, i.e., that the agents' observability form a 
hierarchy.

“First Cycle Games”. 
In: Information and Computation 254
(2017), pp. 195–216. doi: 10.1016/j.ic.2016.10.008.

SUMMARY: In this paper we generalise a classic paper that shows how one can deduce important properties about about mean-payoff games (e.g.,
that players can use memoryless strategies to play optimally) by connecting them to "first-cycle mean-payoff" games, i.e., those in which the winner is determined by the average weight of the first cycle that appears on the play. That classic paper is: 
Ehrenfeucht and J. Mycielski. "Positional strategies for mean payoff games" In: International Journal of Game Theory, 8:109--113, 1979. 

In our paper we define "first-cycle games" as a game in which players move a token along edges of a graph until a cycle is formed 
(the cycle determines the winner). We systematically study first-cycle games, and, in particular, show how to connect these with "ordinary" games (in which the winner is determined by the whole play, not just the first cycle). In particular, we provide an easy-to-use recipe for deciding if agents can use a memoryless strategy to play optimally in an ordinary game. Our recipe easily applies to all known classes of games in which both players can play memorylessly, e.g., reachability games, parity games, energy games, mean-payoff games, etc.

3. Giuseppe De Giacomo, Antonio Di Stasio, Aniello Murano, and Sasha Rubin. “Imperfect information
games and generalized planning”. In: International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI
2016). 2016.

SUMMARY: In this paper we generalise a classic result that shows that a simple "subset-construction" can be used to remove imperfect information 
from finite-state graph-games. That result appears in the 
classic paper:
John H. Reif. 
"Universal games of incomplete information". 
In: Proceedings of the eleventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (STOC '79). 
ACM, New York, NY, USA, 288-308. 
DOI=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/800135.804422

Our paper begins with the observation that this subset-construction does not work on infinite-state games (games with infinitely many states appear in 
models of realistic reactive systems). We then show how to "fix" the construction by using "trajectory constraints", a generalisation of fairness constraints.

4. Benjamin Aminof, Swen Jacobs, Ayrat Khalimov, and Sasha Rubin. “Parameterized Model Checking
of Token-Passing Systems”. In: Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation - 15th
International Conference, VMCAI 2014, San Diego, CA, USA, January 19-21, 2014, Proceedings.
2014, pp. 262–281.

SUMMARY: In this paper we generalise a classic paper that shows how one can model-check properties of distributed systems in a) there is no a-priori bound on the number of processes, and b) processes are arranged on a ring and communicate by token-passing. That classic paper is: 
"Reasoning about Rings", E.A. Emerson, K.S. Namjoshi, POPL, 1995.

In our paper, we supply the largest class of systems for which model-checking *branching-time* logics on *arbitrary* classes of topologies.

Personal Development and Developing Others

I have an interest in engaging in the scholarship of teaching and rigorously investigating
how to improve student learning, especially of abstract and mathematical concepts. In order 
to improve my teaching while at Cornell, I had regular meetings to discuss pedagogy and rigorous 
insights about teaching and learning with David Way, Associate Director of Instructional Support, 
Center for Teaching Excellence, Cornell University (dgw2@cornell.edu). 

While at IST Austria I volunteered as a contact point for PhD students who wanted to discuss any 
aspect of being a PhD student.
