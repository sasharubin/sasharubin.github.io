Furthermore, IMT recognizes "the value of geographical, intersectional, inter− and trans−disciplinary and virtual mobility as an important means of enhancing scientific knowledge and professional development at any stage of a researcher's career" (European Charter for Researchers, Ref. Value of mobility). Therefore, it acknowledges any past mobility experience, encourages mobility at all levels and supports research and projects on interdisciplinary topics and collaborations at an international level.
