I am applying for the position of Lecturer in Data Science with a focus towards Artificial Intelligence.

I am a computer scientist with an interest in Artificial Intelligence, especially knowledge representation, logic, multi-agent systems, and automated planning. 
% As this letter and my CV show, my speciality is formal approaches to Artificial Intelligence, and this informs my research, supervision and teaching since 2014.

\textbf{Background and Esteem.}
My PhD thesis, mentored by Bakhadyr Khoussainov, won the best-doctoral thesis in the faculty of computer science at the University of Auckland. 
I then won a prestigious New Zealand Science and Technology Postdoctoral Fellowship (NZ\$224532) on the same topic. I then held various postdoctoral positions, including a teaching position at Cornell University (2008-2009). Since 2012 I've been working in Formal Methods for Distributed Systems, and since 2014 in Formal Methods for Artificial Intelligence. 
In 2015-2016 I held another individual fellowship, a Marie Curie fellowship (\euro{107000}) jointly funded by the European Research Commission and the Institute for Higher Mathematics (INdAM ``F. Severi'') in Italy, on the topic of Formal Methods for lightweight mobile multi-agent systems, which led to a best-paper award. 


Since 2013, I am chair or organiser of 5 events (workshops and conferences). In 2017 I co-founded and co-organised the 
First Workshop on Formal Methods in Artificial Intelligence (FMAI'17). I serve as a PC member for top AI/MAS conferences including AAAI, IJCAI, and AAMAS. I co-organised the Young Scientists Symposium at IST Austria on the topic ``Understanding Shape: in silico and in vivo''. I am guest editor of two special issues of International workshops and Italian conferences. 
In 2017 I served as an external reviewer for the Icelandic Research Fund and the IRISA Master Research Internship (France).

% My individual work is complemented by my deep integration with world-leaders in AI, including:
% experts in Knowledge Representation (Giuseppe De Giacomo), Automated Planning (Hector Geffner and Blai Bonet), Logic in Computer Science (Moshe Vardi), and Formal Methods in Multi-agent systems (Michael Wooldridge and Alessio Lomuscio).

\textbf{Research.}
My vision is to bring Formal Methods and Artificial Intelligence closer together. This is motivated by the need to ensure that the systems being built using, e.g.,  machine learning, can explain their decisions and actions to human users, so-called ``explainable AI'' (for instance, in healthcare, a diagnostic and prescription system without such features will likely go unused and untrusted). I bring personal expertise on logics and formal methods for temporal, strategic and epistemic reasoning.

The quality of my research can be quickly but roughly gauged from the venues in which I publish (that said, I strongly maintain that the only way to gauge the strength of a paper is for an expert to read it). These include 16 papers [C1-C10, C16, C21, C25, C26, C28, C29] in conferences ranked A* by the CORE ranking (\url{portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/}), 10 of which were published since 2016, as well as a book on verification of distributed systems [B1] (references of the form [X\#] are in the attached CV).
% 's Synthesis Lectures on Distributed Computing Theory series.


\textbf{Teaching and Supervision.}
I work hard at finding angles on the material that will engage my students; this
often involves finding questions that are fun for students to solve, or engaging students 
in big ideas. I seek out, formally and informally, talented teachers and educators from who I can learn best practices as well as some pedagogy theory. 
If I have the opportunity to statistically evaluate teaching strategies and student outcomes then you can expect that I will make an effort to do so.

As evidence of this effort I make some remarks about my teaching at Cornell University 2008-2009.
I sought a number of teaching mentors, including Maria Terrell (Department of Mathematics) and David Way (Centre for Teaching Excellence) 
to discuss successful teaching strategies, both philosophical and concrete. As an example of innovativeness in teaching, I remark that I noticed that students who had read the relevant chapter of the textbook before coming to class would ask much deeper questions in class. 
As a result I instituted a ``pre-class test'' that was administered online and tested whether or not the student had basic knowledge of the contents of the chapter to be covered in class. Although the tests took time to set up and administer, the payoff was enormous to them and me. 



Here is a sample of written student responses to my teaching, the first from my teaching at The University of Cape Town, the rest from Cornell University:

\vspace{1mm}

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] ``\emph{I have enjoyed your maths course the most of all the maths courses I've taken so far. Even more than the content, your delivery was excellent.
I made the decision during one of your lectures to do honours in mathematics and computer science.}''

\item[-] ``\emph{Sasha was a wonderful lecturer -- very organized, clear, and willing to help anyone with difficulties (proactively, as well -- he sought out people who were doing poorly and offered assistance, which was extremely beneficial).}''

\item[-] ``\emph{The class was interesting, fun, and easier. Professor was very well prepared and made us really understand what we were learning by having us write mathematical formulas in words. Instead of memorizing formulas, he helped us understand what we were learning, why we were learning it and why it was useful.}''
\end{itemize}

I am open to teaching theory and programming courses at all levels. 


I have supervised 8 undergraduate students in research, and have mentored three PhD students of Aniello Murano in Italy. All completed projects and collaborations with students resulted in publications in, e.g., IJCAI, AAMAS.

My usual approach to undergraduate supervision is to discuss possible problems with students and let them pick one to work on. 
If the student lacks confidence or is unsure about how to proceed, I create a mini-proposal and timeline for them to follow. I meet with students once a week to discuss progress and troubleshoot. I consider undergraduate research successful if the student a) has fun, b) is challenged, and c) produces and publishes novel research.


\textbf{Integration in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Auckland.}
My recent breakthrough work [C1,C2] on verification of a very broad class of multi-agent systems (in which agents communicate by \emph{broadcast}), as well as previous work on verification of \emph{probabilistic} systems [C25] and verification of \emph{quantitative} properties [C11, C6, C5, J2], has applications to formal methods for analysis of: social networks like twitter; collusions in e-auctions and e-voting; distributed secret sharing and data-dispersal; games with public moves and bids such as poker, etc. This work aligns with the research interests of  \textbf{Ian Duncan Watson} (Game AI), \textbf{Mike Barley} (intelligent systems, mental states, automated planning), \textbf{Jiamou Liu} (multi-agent systems), and \textbf{Muhammad Rizwan Asghar} (security, privacy, distributed systems).
I have recently worked on generalised planning [C4,C10], including a contribution to the ICAPS 2017 Workshop on Generalized Planning [W1], for which 
\textbf{Patricia Riddle} was PC member.
My recent work in logic in computer science, specifically games on graphs [J5], aligns with the stunning breakthrough result about parity games 
of \textbf{Bakhadyr Khoussainov} and \textbf{Cristian Calude}.




% Regarding my approach to curriculum, I believe that computer science curricula should provide students with a rigorous foundation in computational thinking and the reasoning required to design and develop computational systems. Thus, even if there are not many dedicated logic courses, I believe that one can and should inject computational aspects of logic into existing topics, e.g., Boolean logic and satisfiability in courses on discrete mathematics, unique-readability of logical formulas into courses on parsers, first-order logic in courses on databases, etc. Just as important as learning foundations, is developing creativity in students that will be useful in real-world scenarios. To this end I like to motivate and illustrate with examples from robot and mobile-agent control, as well as to provide concrete algorithms, the simplest of which can be simulated by hand.



% While in Naples, I worked closely with two PhD students, resulting in three publications, and I am supervising s an undergraduate thesis.

% Regarding graduate-level teaching and supervision, I have co-taught a 10 hour PhD mini-course on ``Games on Graphs'' at the University of Naples, 
% a 1 semester PhD course on ``Logical Definability and Random Graphs'' at Cornell University in 2009, and 
% a 5 day advanced course on ``Logic and Computation in Finitely Presentable Infinite Structures'' at ESSLLI in 2006. I have also worked closely with two PhD students of Prof. Murano at the University of Naples, also resulting in publications.



% In that sense, content is secondary.
% Content, while essential, can always be learned independently if one knows how to think clearly.

% I am well prepared to incorporate my experience as a learner and a teacher into helping to mold core and elective courses. In particular, I know that one can teach computational ways of thinking to students of all backgrounds (I taught an interactive class 
% to non-mathematics majors at Cornell University titled ``Algorithms and Termination''). I look forward to teaming up with seasoned liberal-arts educators to teach such courses as YSC1212 and YCC1122.
% 
% All this demonstrates I  make a good fit for teaching and supervising students in the MCS major, as well as supervising a Maths, Computational 
% \& Statistical Science Capstone Project. My background in mathematics and computer science means that I can teach a variety of theoretical courses (including pure mathematics courses) as well as programming courses.

%and to expand my work to cover other central aspects of AI such as Formal Methods for Neural Networks.

% 
% \section{Vision for future research}
% My research trajectory is to help bridge two communities: formal-methods and AI. To that end, I plan to continue bringing formal- and logical-methods to bear on questions of importance to computer scientists and society. Notably, ``explainable AI'' (\url{www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence}) will require an integration of Formal Methods, knowledge representation, and machine-learning. 



% The researcher at Yale-NUS whose interests are closest to mine are 
% Aquinas Hobor (verification and automated theorem proving). 

% My ``bread-and-butter'' work consists of developing and applying formal and logical methods. As indicated, for the past few years I have been motivated by applications in AI. One notable example of this convergence is my recent IJCAI17 work with Blai Bonet, Giuseppe De Giacomo, and Hector Geffner which is at the intersection of Formal Methods and automated planning in AI. I am also pursuing more speculative questions such as ``What is synthesis and how should it be formalised?".

I have recently contributed a number of works that import and adapt methodologies and techniques from \FM to
\MAS/\AI [2,3,4,8,10,14,15]. I stress that besides novel technical content, 
my key contributions were to identify which models and techniques from \FM, 
amongst many possibilities, are suitable for \MAS/\AI.
