\section{\mysidestyle {Research Summary}}%\vspace{2mm}

I work in a branch of theoretical computer science that uses mathematical logic to study computation. My time is spent solving mathematical problems, often with a small group of people passionate about the same problems, writing and presenting these results to the academic community in tier 1 conferences (eg. LICS) and journals (eg. BSL). I have supervised three groups of undergraduate research that have led to publications. I have served as referee for journals and conferences in my field and have given a number of invited talks.


\section{\mysidestyle {Writing}}%\vspace{2mm}
I take great pride in my writing. I have written three surveys of my field, each for a different audience (logicians, computer scientists, mathematicians).

\section{\mysidestyle{Undergraduate Teaching}}

%I have taught at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. 
My goal as a teacher is to guide students through the material (eg. I point out which ideas are fundamental and which are technicalities), show students how the material is relevant to their degree, and help students think deeply. I discover good teaching principles by regularly self-evaluating and engaging colleagues.
% (eg. is there a better way of breaking the material into chunks to help students follow?).
%and engage colleagues in discussions
% in order to improve my presentation %of the material, 
For instance, I have learned to employ questions which encourage students to express themselves clearly and internalise the material, eg. `can anyone help A with her answer?', `can you explain B's idea to me?', `what do you mean by X?', `are you sure?'.%,   `who will summarise today's class?'.
%,  `if all I do is teach you skills I'm short-changing you'.

\section{\mysidestyle{Travel}}
I have lived in different countries (South Africa, Israel, USA, Germany, Austria) and have travelled widely, both for academic positions and to learn first-hand about the world and its people. I typically choose to visit a region to learn and experience some of the musical traditions there --- for instance I learned Ewe music in Ghana and Maracatu in Brasil.
