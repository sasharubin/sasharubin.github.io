\tit{Summary of Research Interests}

My work studies the descriptive power of automata theory and mathematical logic for describing mathematical structures. 
Concretely, I have worked in the area of automatic structures, verification, and in finite model
theory. I am currently working on the analysis of distributed systems and algorithms using logical and automata-theoretic methods.
%in particular verification of probabilistic finite state systems.
