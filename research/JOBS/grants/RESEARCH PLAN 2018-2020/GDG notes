logics in ai/KR = GDG
they like what formal methods can bring to AI
precious person
need to show that you are really interested in AI, not application of techniques to AI

RESEARCH PLAN
- start talking about AI
- FM can help AI
- show you are working FOR AI.
- show how FM can help AI
e.g., planning for TEG is based on FM
e.g., generalised planning/synthesis based on FM

- now lets focus on the environment
clearly a first-class citizen in AI, obviosly every AI system has description of the environ.
however, a specific study of the env has only been looked at in MAS architecture. often it is just another agent.
but you can have a very rich notion... you embed certain constraints (topo, comm etc). and this is connected to 
work in FM. this is not done in FM, but other notions in FM that can be exploited... 

- going to HELP AI (NOT FM).

however there are techniques in FM that can be used and *extended* to have a sophisticated 
notion of environment

- SHOW OFF YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN FM 
- I see lots of connections between logic based AI and FM.
- I see that AI is looking at very crucial problems and these problems are not 
the same, but they resonate with FM. these two fields developed separately, I think I am 
the person that can show these connections.
- show I want to collaborate with everybody. as with GDG, HG, ...
- think how i interact with GDG not NM (somehow lucky that FM to MAS).
- show why DEEP knowledge is needed; not just to know that there are connections. show there 
are differences. superficially looks the same. synthesis is offline; planning is done offline by an agent
that is acting that moment in the world (cannot spent a week, got just a few minutes). this changes the perspective.
e.g., solving easy problems is the bread-butter in planning; irrelevant in synthesis. 

in spite of the differences can use the UNDERSTANDING/INSIGHTS/THEORIES (not just results) in FM to tackle problems in AI. 
going to recycle the INSIGHTS, not the results, TO GENERATE NEW RESULTS IN AI.
e.g., our ijcai papers. and our work on synthesis...

mention PMC and swarms!!

GOING TO ADVANCE AI BECAUSE OF MY KNOWLEDGE IN FM
HOW?
- good model of env
- synthesis and planning and how i have been using it to do gen planning
- PMC and how it is being used by others for SWARMS (Alessio Lomuscio)
i.e., studying AI but from a unique perspective that I have developed due to 
10 years of work in verification and synthesis.

Have a grid that is nxn... use Finite Model Theory... constrain logic that it only uses finite models.

discussion in AI: 
- does it make sense to ground everything... should we use FOL? but in PDDL the solvers ground.
- ASP is also always grounded, and does better than PROLOG.
* everyone has the feeling that avoiding grounding is better. but we don't have the science to prove this*
they will be happy that i am interested in this.


- i am genuinely interested in the issues in AI. 
this is not typical.

- puts me in a fantastic position
- i am doing logic with ADVANCED techniques
parity games, FMT, automata theory, that have not yet penetrated AI
safety game is contrary of reachability. take advantage of techniques in planning.

- Michael Tischler is GGP person.
he runs the competition
he wrote a book on GGP
lots of invited talks
what can you do for GGP?
using game theoretic notions in GGP.


1. how is env treated?
2. how can FM help GGP? FMT...

- agent uses logic to reason... problem of omniscience... want to clip the reasoning mechanism itself.
agents should not be theorem provers
- 
- axiomatisations not considered that important in AI; expressibility yes, algorithms yes.
