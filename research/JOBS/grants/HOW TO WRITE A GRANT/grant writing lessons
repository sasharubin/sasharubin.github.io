GRANTS

 Grant writing lessons
- NELLO: Can quickly write a project on any of previous papers!!!
- goals should be crisp
- research issues = problems in achieving goals, i.e., point out how state of the art fails!
- don't have to show that you looked at every little detail
- have a CLEAR idea of what the proposal should be about before writing.
- if don'y have clear idea of how to solve problems, at least point to recent papers of your where have made preliminary steps.

From Florian's START:
- Motivated by the progress in resource bound analysis, we will consider new application domains,
which ***combine different challenges*** and which are out of reach for current bound analysis
- In ongoing unpublished work,
we also support this claim experimentally

- NELLO can apply for travel money from indam??

- MOSHE: get money for practical projects; use 80% for the grant, 20% for theory.

"whereby several researchers with eclectic backgrounds and complementry talents get together to advance the state of the art in a joint area of research. 
This branch in particular (Tools for Concurrent and Distributed Systems) appears to have played a central role in the NFN project, as it deals with concerns 
that are focal points of the project, and it draws on the expertise of several team members and collaborators."

JIAMOU: X (logic, etc etc) bridges macro (population) and micro (indidvual)

FEDORA - for better batery life

argumentation: search for infinite argumentation space

DENNET: ted talk, interview on point of inquiry.

PLANNING?
2 player GAMES ON GRAPHS? LTL, discounted, mean payoff. FCGs!

Nello: paid 300 eur for imperial accom (+200 from prima = 500).
