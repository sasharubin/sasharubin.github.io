% The abstract (summary) should, at a glance, provide the reader with a clear understanding of the objectives of the research proposal and how they will be achieved. The abstract will be used as the short description of your research proposal in the evaluation process and in communications to contact in particular the potential remote referees and/or inform the Commission and/or the programme management committees and/or relevant national funding agencies (provided you give permission to do so where requested in the online proposal submission forms, section 1). It must therefore be short and precise and should not contain confidential information.

We are witnessing an increasing availability of \textbf{mechanisms}
that offer some form of programmability.
%%
These include software, manufacturing devices, smart objects and
spaces, intelligent robots, %through to 
business process management systems, and
many others.
%%
All these mechanisms are  currently being revolutionized by means of
advances in Machine Learning, which facilitate the availability of sensing
 (vision and language understanding) and actuation
capabilities (robot-arm movement and camera pointing).
%%
 % However, irrespective of the technological nature of these
 % components, the connections between them are still organized,
 % monitored, and coordinated through standard manual programming.
 However, 
% irrespective of the technological progresses of these
 % components, 
such mechanisms are held back by the fact that the connections
 between components are still organized and coordinated through
 standard programming.

\project %(pronounced ``wisemech'') 
aims at developing the {science} and the {tools} for a new
generation of mechanisms to emerge: mechanisms that are able to
\textbf{program themselves} without human intervention, 
automatically tailor their behavior so as to
achieve desired goals, maintain themselves within safe boundaries in a
changing environment, and  follow regulations and conventions
that evolve over time.
%%
Crucially, empowering mechanisms with self-programming carries significant risks and we must be able to \textbf{balance power with safety}. For this reason
\project intends 
to realize mechanisms that are \textbf{white-box},
that is, 
that are {guarded by human guided
specifications}, which, together with the synthesized behavior, 
are fully verifiable and comprehensible in human terms.
% Note that such mechanisms might incorporate black-box
% ML-components, though with suitable safety guarantees.


Remarkable recent discoveries by the applicant in \textbf{Reasoning about Action} and \textbf {Generalized Planning} in AI, %connecting these areas to
and their connections to
Verification and Synthesis in Formal Methods, and Data-aware Processes in Databases, chart an unanticipated novel path to produce a breakthrough in realizing \textbf{powerful self-programming mechanisms}, while keeping them  \textbf{human-comprehensible and safe by design}.
%%
% By doing so \project will bring together and cross-fertilize four distinct research areas, namely \textbf{Reasoning about Action}, %in \emph{Knowledge Representation}, 
% \textbf{Data-aware Processes} in \emph{Databases}, \textbf{Verification and Synthesis} in \emph{Formal Methods},  and \textbf{Planning}.% in \emph{AI}.

% Scientifically, integrating insights from four areas:
% %1
% \textbf{Knowledge Representation} on how to represent the domain
% of interest and the mechanisms' sensing and acting capabilities in a
% high-level human comprehensible fashion,
% %2
% \textbf{Data-aware Processes} in \emph{Databases} on how to
% build data-aware dynamic behaviors,
% %3
% \textbf{Verification and Synthesis} in \emph{Formal
%   Methods}, which provides mathematically elegant foundations for
% synthesis,
% %4
% and \textbf{Automated Planning} in \emph{AI}, which yields
% algorithmic insights into the search process required by synthesis.
% %
% In this way \project will \textbf{bring together and cross-fertilize
%   four distinct research areas} with overlapping interests to produce a \textbf{breakthrough in engineering self-programming mechanisms that are human-comprehensible and safe by design}.

% Note that while \project is not about ML, it intends to incorporate
% into white-box self-programming mechanisms black-box ML-components,
% though with suitable safety guarantees.

\project will ground its scientific results upon diverse
\textbf{driving applications}, including smart manufacturing
(Industry 4.0), smart spaces (IoT) and business process management systems
(BPM).
