% PI's research activity has concerned theoretical, methodological and realization aspects in different areas of CS and AI, most prominently: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning; Reasoning about Actions and Planning; Autonomous Agents; Service Composition and Orchestration; Process Modeling, Verification and Synthesis; Semantic Technologies and Ontologies; Description Logics; and Data Management and Integration. 

% The PI has deep impact on several areas of CS and AI. 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  Mid 90's, \textbf{Correspondence between description logics and logics of programs}, his PhD thesis, deeply influenced expressive description logics ultimately leading to the definition of the W3C Standards OWL and OWL2. 
% % (AAAI94,KR96, JAIR96). 

% \item Late 90's \textbf{Conjunctive query answering in description logics}, 
%  with D.\ Calvanese, and M.\ Lenzerini, opened up the research on enabling the use of description logics for query databases. 
% % (PODS'98 - 419 cit, TOCL - 87 cit.).

% \item Early of 00's, \textbf{ConGolog programming language based on Situation Calculus},  with Y.\ Lesperance and H.\ Levesque, introduced the now standard transition semantics based programming languages in reasoning about action. 
% %(AIJ'00 - 652 cit).

% \item Early of 00's, \textbf{Planning using automata-theoretic
%     techniques from Verification}, together with M.\ Vardi, pioneered
%   studying advanced form of planning using techniques used from
%   Verification and Synthesis. % (ECP'99).

% \item Early 00's \textbf{Rich theory on regular path queries for views based query answering in
%      graph databases}, with D.\ Calvanese, M.\ Lenzerini, M.\ Vardi, a corner stone of the research in the field.

% \item Mid 00's  \textbf{Composition of stateful services}
%  with D.\ Berardi, M.\ Mecella and M.\ Lenzerini, on of the most influential framework for service composition, original paper (ICSOC'03) won the most influential paper of the decade at ICSOC'13.

% \item Mid 00's \textbf{Automated reasoning on UML Class Diagrams},
%  with D.\ Berardi, D.\ Calvanese,  EXPTIME-complete characterization reasoning on UML diagrams, deeply influential in formal analysis of conceptual object models.% (AIJ'05).

% \item Late 00's \textbf{DL-lite family: description logics with tractable data complexity},
%  with D.\ Calvanese,  M.\ Lenzerini, R.\ Rosati,  developed during EU TONES, made it possible to use description logic ontologies with dealing with big data (see EU OPTIQUE) % (JODS07 - 1131 cit.)

% \item Late 00's \textbf{Ontology Based Data Access} 
%  with D.\ Calvanese,  D.\ Lembo, M.\ Lenzerini, A.\ Poggi, R.\ Rosati, the most used framework using semantic technologies for data integration (Lutz's ERC consolidator grant CODA is based on it). 


% \item Early 10's \textbf{Advanced planning by model checking game structures},
% with F. Patrizi and S. Sardina and others,  cross-fertilization among planning, service-composition and syntesis by model checking game structures led to some of the most influential forms of generalized planning.

% \item Mid 10's \textbf{Decidability of data-aware processes}
%  with D.\ Calvanese, A.\ Deutsch, M.\ Montali,  developed during EU ACSI, cross-fertilization among databases, verification and knowledge representation, led to fundations for decidable verifiability of data-aware processes. % (PODS'13).

% \item Late 10's \textbf{Bounded situation calculus}
%  with Y.\ Lesperance and F. Patrizi, defined general condition for decidable verification of situation calculus.

% \item Late 10's \textbf{Verification, synthesis, planning using LTL and LDL over finite traces}
%  with M.\ Vardi, of interest in AI and declarative processes, promises to be a revolution in synthesis since sidesteps notorious constructions required for infinite traces.  
% \end{itemize}

\subsection*{INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP}
\vspace{-1ex}

A pioneer project in 2003 with IBM Tivoli Lab highlighted several fundamental limitations in using semantic technologies available at that time for knowledge management. This gave rise to a novel research line that led to a new kind of Description Logic, called DL-Lite, and a new paradigm for accessing data through semantic technologies, called Ontology-based Data Access (OBDA). Since then, the PI led several industrial explorations promoting OBDA for data integration, preparation and discovery, which involved private and public organizations, such as the Monte dei Paschi di Siena Bank, Italian Minstery of Finance and Economics, Telecom Italia, Bloomberg, Italian Automobil Club (current). The success of such explorations has led the PI to found the Sapienza Start Up \textbf{OBDA Systems} (\url{http://www.obdasystems.com}) in Feb.\ 2017. The PI has been also a Contributor to W3C  recommendation of  OWL 2 Web Ontology Language 
Profiles (\url{https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/}).

 % In a notable project with the Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank, during the acquisition of Banca Antonveneta, an ontology has been built regarding all customer data and the associated risk management tasks, and mappings between the ontology and the existing data sources have been defined. Similar projects have been carried out with Selex SI about data on satellite equipments, Telecom Italia about the data on the Italian Telecommunication Network,  the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance about the data regarding the Italian public debt, and the Autom

 % In all the above contexts, the combination of front- and back-end scalability problems had led to an inflexible and slow regime in which only a fixed set of predefined queries, optimized and tuned for their purpose, was available to the domain experts. This severely hampered the ability to explore and analyze the data, and prevented from fully exploiting and creating value out of it. The OBDA approach enabled from the one hand the establishment of new data governance functions, and, on the other hand, with the use of MASTRO, a new way to deal with data access. Queries about the domain are now posed over the ontology, and the reasoning system derives the answers by rewriting it over the real data sources. Among the various advantages of the new framework, non-IT experts can now access relevant data in much more easy and flexible ways. In all the above contexts, the success of the project led to extend the collaboration with the University of Roma La Sapienza with the aim of replicating the approach in order to cover the whole domain of the organization, as well as the whole set of data sources within the organization.
