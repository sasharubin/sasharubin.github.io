<h3>Introduction</h3>

This document summarizes my experience and advice (and the advice I
received from others) on looking for jobs in academia and industrial
research labs in the field of computer science. It covers both general
advice and my particular job search for a programming languages / software
engineering position in the Spring of 2005. It is structured as a how-to
guide for graduate students.

<a name="ack"><h3>Acknowledgments</h3></a>

Many wise and wonderful people were kind enough to grant me the boon of
their wisdom on this subject. They include, but are not limited to: 
<font size=-2>
<ul>
<li>Alex Aiken (Stanford) 
<li>Ras Bodik (Berkeley) 
<li>Katherine Compton (Wisconsin) 
<li>Richard Fateman (Berkeley) 
<li>Jill Findeis (PSU) 
<li>Stephen Freund (Williams) 
<li>Patrice Godefroid (Bell Labs)
<li>Sumit Gulwani (Microsoft)
<li>Tom Henzinger (EPFL) 
<li>Ranjit Jhala (UCSD) 
<li>Iain Keddie (IBM) 
<li>Jim Larus (Microsoft) 
<li>David Liben-Nowell (Carleton)
<li>Tessa Lau (IBM) 
<li>Rupak Majumdar (UCLA) 
<li>Wayne McMullen (PSU)
<li>Greg Morrisett (Harvard) 
<li>George Necula (Berkeley) 
<li>Jens Palsberg (UCLA) 
<li>Sriram Rajamani (Microsoft) 
<li>David Shoenthal (Longwood)
<li>Raj Varma (Delaware)
<li>Mark Wegman (IBM) 
<li>Donna Weimer (Juniata)
</ul>
</font>
You may safely assume that all of the good ideas here come from them and
that all bad advice comes from me.  
<p>
In addition, I've included some publicly-available application materials
for comparison and convenience. You could get them off of archive.org
yourself if you so desired. 

<A name="letters"><h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3></a>

You will need four letters of recommendation, one of which will come from
your advisor. The typical dilemma here involves finding the other three. 
You may well have only published papers with your advisor and the
supervisor from you summer internship. Where do you find two others? 
<p>
Start now! Email some of the other professors in your department and make
appointments to talk to them about your research and your plans. Ask them
if they have any ideas, talk about possible collaborations, convince them
to critique drafts of your papers, whatever. The more they know you the
better and you may even get research ideas out of it. 
<p>
If you plan to do your job search interviews in the Spring of Year X, talk
to your advisor about who should write your letters in the Summer of Year
X-1 (or earlier!) and then ask them by the end of that summer. Give them
plenty of warning. 
<p>
At the end of the day, however, I can only offer myself as a data point for
what was "good enough". I had never written a paper with Alex Aiken but I
had corresponded with him since the end of my undergraduate days. We had
similar research interests, I almost ended up as his advisee, we got along
well at research group lunches, I went to his office more than once to talk
about research and ideas, and he invited me to Stanford to give a practice
talk. I had written a paper with Tom Henzinger, sat in on one of his
classes, and visited his office once or twice to talk about things and ask
for advice. I had never written a paper with Jim Larus but he supervised my
internship at Microsoft Research and was familiar with my research work. 
Left to my own devices, I would have chosen Sriram Rajamani (also from my
internship) instead of Jim since he knew me better personally, but it was
suggested that Jim's more senior position and experience in both industry
and academia would lead to a more useful reference. Talk to your advisors. 

<a name="general"><h3>Where To Apply In General</h3></a>

If you plan to be doing your job search interviews in the Spring of Year X
you must submit applications in the Fall of Year X-1 (or by January 15-ish
of Year X). You must decide where you will be applying early because
different categories of institutions have different deadlines. 
<p>
Despite the canonical "industry versus academia" phrasing, there are
actually a number of choices:
<ul>
<li> <b>Research Academia</b>. This includes "top-ten" schools like MIT,
CMU, Berkeley, Stanford, and Cornell as well schools with lower rankings
like UC Irvine, Purdue, Rutgers and Virginia. This is the default type of
application. Your applications will be due around December or January. 

<li> <B>Industrial Research Labs</b>. This includes Microsoft Research, IBM
Research (T.J. Watson), Intel Labs, Bell Labs, Sun Labs, NEC, Google, and
so on.  Industry tends to feature "rolling interviews" (they aren't on
Academia's semester clock) but they will do most of their interviewing for
this type of position at the same time as academia will. 

<li> <b>Industrial "Startups"</b>. This includes Ph.D.-seeking high-tech
companies in your particular area or recently-formed startups. Examples
include Coverity, Green Hills, Fortify and EMC. These also generally follow
Industry's looser time clock. I have no personal experience with this type
of work, but others suggest that it typically involves taking a research
idea much further than you would in academia. Over the course of years you
take a good idea from concept to product with all of the steps along the
way (e.g., documentation, testing, shipping, marketing). Advice I've
received suggests that this is actually very rewarding and that "right out
of school" is a not a bad time to try it. 

<li> <B>Non-US US-Like Research Academia</b>. This includes McGill and UBC
in Canada, EPFL in Switzerland and lesser-known places like John Cabot
University in Italy.  These schools are located outside of the US but
follow US practices with respect to tenure and research and conduct classes
in English. This is basically just like a job at a US university. The trick
here is that they tend not to take US applicants seriously. US applicants
typically tend (for whatever reason -- picking the known over the unknown,
staying close to family, trying to use such places as safety schools, etc.)
not to accept jobs at such places even when they are offered. I recommend
including an explicit notice in your cover letter and research statement
detailing (in a few sentences) why you really want to go there and why they
should take you seriously (e.g., you speak the language, you have family
there, you are not tied to the US, whatever). 

<li> <b>Non-US Research Academia</b>. This includes places like ENS in
France, Oxford in the UK and Tsinghua in China. These places may not
conduct classes in English, usually have a different promotion and tenure
scheme, and often have different requirements (e.g., they may expect a
post-doc or a second degree and they are rumored to tend to hire "locally").
I can't help you here, and in general if you don't already know much more
about this corner of the world than I do you shouldn't count on ending up
at one of these places. 

<li> <B>Top-Tier Teaching Academia</b>. This includes places like Carleton,
Williams, Wesleyan, Oberlin and Brown. Faculty here still conduct research
but undergraduate education is emphasized and the graduate program (and
thus graduate students) will be smaller or non-existent. (As an aside, a
<i>university</i> has a graduate program and a <i>college</i> does not.) 
Teaching at least 3 courses per year is common. The interview schedule for
such schools is typically one to two months ahead of the schedule for
Research Academia. Your application and letters of recommendation will be
due weeks in advance as well. Thus if you plan on applying to such a school
you must have all of your references ready early. 

<li> <B>Teaching Academia</b>. This includes standard small liberal arts
universities that you probably haven't heard of unless you're from the
locale. Shippensburg, Lock Haven, Haverford, Juniata and Ithaca College are
all good examples. Here the emphasis will be on undergraduate education,
undergraduate advising and scholarship (to the possible exclusion of the
constantly-publishing-papers type of research). Teaching 6 courses a year
is common. In addition, the salary will probably be around half of what you
would receive from the Research Academia category. 

<li> <b>"Instructor" Positions</b>. Most top-tier schools (Berkeley and 
Virginia are both examples) have full-time "instructor" positions. These
positions may or may not be tenure-track (and often are not). They tend to
cover teaching undergraduate "service" courses (freeing up the research
faculty to do other things). In such a position you typically have no
research requirements but a high teaching requirement of CS100-ish classes.
It's my personal impression that these positions tend to open up fairly
rarely. If you are interested in one you must seek advice elsewhere (e.g.,
with the instructors or CS education faculty at your university). 

<li> <B>Standard Industry</b>. If you want to get a job as a normal
Microsoft Developer, your Ph.D. certainly qualifies you. You don't need
this document in that case. Typically grad students aren't interested in
standard dev jobs, but it might be handy to remember that they're out there
if you're jousting with a two-body problem. There is something to be said
for having your work "end" when you go home for the evening or the weekend. 

<li> <b>Post-Docs</b>. Post-docs are somewhat rare in Computer Science
(at least in our neck of the woods). Traditionally European grad students
apply for post-docs in the US and then apply for another job later.
Post-doc positions typically use the same calendar as Research Academia.
Taking a post-doc gives you time to flush out your resume with additional
publications. On the other hand, if you have taken a post-doc people will
expect you resume to be flush with publications. The typical advice is that
if you can possibly get a job without getting a post-doc, just get the job. 

</ul>
Having enumerated all of those possible options, I will now conveniently
forget all of them except research academia and industrial research labs.
<p>
Ultimately you must decide what sort of positions you will apply for on
your own. A research position is not inherently "better" or "worse" than a
teaching position -- they are made up of different things. Find out what
makes you happy. 

<a name="particular"><h3>Where To Apply In Particular</h3></a>

Now that you know the sorts of jobs you're looking for you still have to find
actual jobs to apply for. Here are some approaches:
<ul>
<li> <b>Word of Mouth</b>. If you mention that you'll be on the job market
shortly, people at conference will tell you if their department is hiring.
They may even offer to shepherd your application and make sure that it
doesn't get lost (since you're at the same conference they probably like
you and the sort of work you do, so this isn't all that uncommon). You can
expect two or three of these from a big conference. They're not required. 

<li> <b>ACM</b>. The ACM keeps a database of CS jobs that you can search
through. The blurbs there tend to be hard to follow, so I recommend that
you get the names of places from the ACM and then go to the department
website (or whatnot) on your own. 

<li> <b>Rankings + Google</b>. Get a list of department rankings. The two
most popular are from US News & World Report and the CRA Taulbee Survey. Go
to the department website of every school in the top 30 or top 40 and see
if they are advertising an opening. Note that they probably won't have the
advertisement up until the middle of the Fall Semester. 

<li> <b>Ask Around</b>. Your advisor will probably start to forward job
offers to you. Ask you recently-graduated friends if they know anyone who
is hiring. 
</ul>

All of the job postings you find in academia will use basically the same
boilerplate ad copy (e.g., "we encourage all qualified applicants from all
areas of computer science to apply, we are an equal-opportunity ...").
Beyond that, there are two ways the ads are typically formed: 
<ul>
<li> 
One says "we are particularly looking for people in bioinformatics and
datamining, ...", at which point you shouldn't get your hopes up unless
you're in those areas. Here's a concrete example from Purdue's 2005
search (emphasis mine):
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-2>
  The Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue University invites
  applications for tenure-track positions beginning August 2005. Positions
  are available at the Assistant Professor level; senior positions will be
  considered for highly qualified applicants. Applications from outstanding
  candidates in all areas of computer science will be considered. <i>Of
  particular interest are candidates in the areas of programming languages
  and compilers, software engineering, operating systems, data mining, and
  bioinformatics.</i>
</font>
</ul>

<li> The other kind of ad says "our department has strengths in areas X, Y
and Z and we are looking for people who can either augment or complement
those strengths", at which point you really have no information since
they've covered all of the bases. Here's a concrete example from Virginia's
2005 search (emphasis mine): 
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-2>
  The University of Virginia ranks consistently as one of the top public
  universities in the country. Its highly valued Department of Computer
  Science has a diverse population with more than 300 undergraduate
  students, 110 graduate students, and 28 faculty members. The department
  offers baccalaureate, master, and doctoral degrees in Computer Science
  and Computer Engineering. The department is undergoing significant growth
  and programmatic evolution and aims to be one of the top departments in
  experimental systems research and the leading institution in
  undergraduate computer science education. <i>Its existing strengths include
  algorithms, architecture, compilers, distributed systems, graphics, grid
  computing, mobile computing, networks, operating systems, programming
  environments, real-time and embedded systems, security, sensor networks,
  and software engineering.</i> 
</font>
</ul>
</ul>
I applied to 21 places and got 8 interviews and 5 job offers. Rumor has it
that getting interviews at 33% of your places is average and that the best
person in a particular field-year will get around 50%. A very strong
candidate in my field-year (in my opinion the strongest candidate) applied
to 30 places, got 17 interview offers, went on 15 interviews and got 7 job
offers. When considering these data points, note that Spring 2005 was
considered to have "strong competition" and "many strong applicants" in
PL/SE (almost everywhere I interviewed remarked on it). If you are in a
"non-standard" CS field like HCI the numbers are probably completely
different. If you are trying to solve the two-body problem you should be
applying to at least 40 places. Some couples do 60. 

<a name="org"><h3>Organizing Things For Your Letter-Writers</h3></a>

The standard practice these days is to make a web page or chart listing all
of the places to which letters must be sent as well as the due dates. Most
of the places will allow letters to be emailed and a few of them will
require that letters be sent physically. Make it easy to cut and paste the
addresses. One or two places will require that the letter-writer submit
some special on-line form. Some will contact your letter-writers directly.
Loosely, your letter-writers will write the letters a day or two before the
first one is due and then send them all out. 
<p>
<a href="list.html">You can see my letter-writer chart here.</a> It's not
perfect and I'm sure you could improve on the format but no one complained.
It should also give you an idea of how the due dates vary between top-tier
teaching-ish schools (e.g., Oberlin at November 19) and standard research
schools (e.g. CMU at January 15). 
<p>
As an aside, it is <i>very common</i> for letters of recommendation to fail
to make it all the way to the people who need to see them. I had at least
six places email me and tell me that only one or two of my letters got
through, and asking me to have the others emailed directly to some address. 
Some UC-system schools are infamous for letter mishaps (e.g., losing more
or less every letter from one year's worth of applicants). It is quite
reasonable to send follow-up email to your target departments asking if all
of your letters have made it in to your applicant file (this also shows
interest in the position, but I personally doubt anyone will notice at this
stage). 
<p>
Finally, as a courtesy you should try to get email addresses (instead of
overland mail addresses) for all of your target schools. This is
especially true if any of your letter writers are in another country. Some
schools will only post a snail-mail address on the web page but will divulge
a secret email account if you pester them via email (bonus points if you
can turn this problem into a well-founded induction). 

<A name="prep"><h3>Preparing Your Application: Cover Letter and
Resume</h3></a>

Your application will almost invariably consist of a resume, a teaching
statement, a research statement and a cover letter. 
<p>
The cover letter is the least important element, but if you get it wrong
your entire application may be mistakenly misfiled and not considered. The
key points to cover include who you are, what you are applying for (include
any special numbers) and what you are including. If someone on the inside
told you to apply, mention that. Here are concrete examples:
<ul>
<li> <a href="weimer-cover-letter.pdf">Weimer Generic Cover Letter</a>.
<li> <a href="rj-cover-generic3.pdf">Ranjit Jhala Generic Cover Letter</a>.
<li> <a href="weimer-cover-letter-umass.pdf">Weimer UMass-Amherst Cover
Letter (including job search number)</a>. 
</ul>
<p>
Resume-writing is well-established although the many of the standard
techniques aren't as applicable at this level (e.g., it is my personal
impression that your previous work experience doesn't really matter). You
want to emphasize your publications and any teaching experience you might
have. Also list all of your references one more time (sometimes people
actually call your references to get more information). If I were doing
this all over again I would list my publication venues all at once in some
topic sentence (e.g., "I have published in POPL, PLDI, TOPLAS, OOPSLA,
...") because I have seen people at interviews skim my resume for exactly
that venue summary while I sat before them. 
<p>
At many places my resume appeared to be the only thing that actually made
it through the application bureaucracy to people. At least four times I saw
people explicitly looking over my resume either as I was coming in to the
interview or while I was sitting down. By contrast, I never heard anyone
mention my research statement. 
<p>
Anyway, here's my resume from when I was applying, which again serves
largely as a lower-bound on required content and style. Also included are a
few other examples. 
<ul>
<li> <a href="begel-cv.pdf">Andy Begel Resume</a> 
<li> <a href="lerner-cv.pdf">Sorin Lerner Resume</a> 
<li> <a href="weimer-resume.pdf">Weimer Resume</a> 
<li> <a href="whaley-cv.pdf">John Whaley Resume</a> 
</ul>

Note that if you are applying for any sort of teaching job (e.g., top-tier
teaching academia, small liberal arts college, instructor position) your
teaching qualifications (courses taught and letters talking about it)
should be at least as good as mine and hopefully much better (more like
Andy Begel's above, say). Mine were the bare minimum required (e.g., they
sufficed to get me an interview at Wesleyan) but they were mentioned as a
concern (until I was able to convince them with my presentation) and I have
no doubt that other teaching places rejected me because of them. Teaching
jobs will also want multiple numerical evaluations (e.g., I was asked
explicitly what my numerical teaching evaluations were at Wesleyan, and I
imagine that they're even more serious about it at other departments). 

<a name="state"><h3>Preparing Your Application: Teaching and Research
Statements</h3></a>

The traditional approach here is to craft your research statement by
summarizing your thesis proposal and to craft your teaching statements by
looking at what others have written and fumbling around. Here are some
concrete examples:
<ul>
<li> <a href="begel-research.pdf">Andy Begel Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="Jhala-Research.pdf">Ranjit Jhala Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="lerner-research.pdf">Sorin Lerner Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="liblit-res.html">Ben Liblit Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="weimer-research.pdf">Weimer Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="whaley-research.pdf">John Whaley Research Statement</a>
<p>
<li> <a href="begel-teaching.pdf">Andy Begel Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="lerner-teaching.pdf">Sorin Lerner Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="Jhala-Teaching.pdf">Ranjit Jhala Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="weimer-teaching.pdf">Weimer Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="whaley-teaching.pdf">John Whaley Teaching Statement</a>
</ul>
References aren't required in a research statement, but they don't hurt if
you feel better with them (or if you have a bunch of publications and want
to highlight that). 
<p>
Almost all teaching statements seem to end up looking somewhat identical
(see Lerner, Jhala and Whaley above). At Wesleyan, the only place I went
that mentioned my teaching statement at all, they mentioned that it was
creative and the best one they had seen in a while.  Given how interesting
mine isn't, that gives you a good idea for how low the bar is set if you
want to do something personal with your teaching statement. Being
yourself is still key, however. Not everyone should go for a teaching
statement in which they claim not to be nice. Andy Begel's emphasis on
education results in something of an upper bound on teaching statement
impressiveness (unless you're actually in CS education), and a statement
like his would fit in well if you're aiming for a teaching job. 
<p>
It's worth noting that many people feel that their statements don't really
reflect who they are as people. Some are of the opinion that job
application materials necessarily adopt a "putting yourself forward" or
"please hire me" tone that's not indicative of how the person really
behaves in general. Writing these statements can take a surprisingly long
time because your own draft efforts will invariably sound stupid to you. 
<p>
Aside from asking your friends to show you their statements, a good way to
get these things is to download them one year early. Almost everyone puts
their job application materials up on their web page when they are applying
for a job. In May/June, Googling for <tt>programming languages "teaching
statement"</tt> yields hundreds of results. Just download sound and save
them. Of course, if you get random people from the Internet you probably
won't have heard of them and thus won't know if they are good or bad
examples. So try to soak up all of the documents from people in your
department that you can get a read on.  Make sure that yours are available
on-line as well. Many places, even places to which you have officially sent
materials, will get the versions off of you web page because the official
application materials get lost in the bureaucracy or were printed out
somewhere or somesuch. I was involved in multiple phone and sit-down
interviews where people mentioned reading the materials from my web page as
we were talking. 
<p>
While we're on the subject, people will, in fact, read the details of your
web page when they are considering you as a candidate. For example, Dave
Evans at Virginia mentioned (somewhat tongue-in-cheek, somewhat not) that
one of the reasons he knew I would fit in and be a solid hire is that he
read and liked the parody programming languages examination test on my
web page. I had multiple people comment on the photos or hobbies mentioned
on my web page. 

<a name="submit"><h3>Submitting Your Application</h3></a>

Nothing surprising here. Email it in. Often they will ask for everything to
be in PDF format. Sometimes they'll even want everything in a single PDF
file, so be prepared to achieve that. 
<p>
For the applications that you have to physically mail, print out address
labels in advance and don't send them via some bottom-of-the-barrel cheap
carrier plan. You'll probably be at this job for at least seven years. It's
worth $5 to make sure that your application materials get there. 

<A name="wait"><h3>The Waiting Game</h3></a>

You probably submitted your materials in the middle of December. However,
you won't really hear anything from anyone until at least the middle of
January when the faculty can get together and review the applications. Be
sure to check your email during this time, however. At the end of December,
Michigan sent me an email saying that there was a mix up with my application
and asking me to resend my letters of recommendation. Unfortunately, it was
sorted to my spam folder and I didn't find it until March, at which point
it was too late. Don't be me: try to avoid losing potential interviews for
reasons not related to your merits. 
<p>
While you're waiting you will receive a bunch of emails that say "we
received your application, we're starting a folder for it" or "we have
received all of your letters of recommendation". If you're not getting that
kind of thing you should send them follow-up email. 
<p>
Here's (a subset of) my application information timeline: 
<ul>
<li> <font color="purple">Jan 11. IBM Research invitation to interview.
</font>
<li> <font color="purple">Jan 15. Purdue invitation to interview.</font>
<li> <font color="purple">Jan 27. McGill invitation to interview. </font>
<li> <font color="purple">Jan 31. Virginia invitation to interview.</font>
<li> Feb 17. UMass-Amherst invitation to phone interview. 
<li> Feb 21. UMass-Amherst phone interview.

<li> <font color="purple">Apr 04. Wesleyan invitation to interview. </font>
<li> Apr 05-10. Present paper at conference. 
<li> <font color="red">Apr 06. EPFL and Wisconsin reject me without an

<li> <font color="blue">Apr 12-14. NYU interview.</font>
<li> <font color="blue">Apr 14-16. Wesleyan interview. </font>
<li> <font color="green">Apr 25. UMass-Amherst makes an official offer,

<li> <font color="green">May 14. NYU makes an official offer. </font>
<li> <font color="red">May 31. MSR rejects me. </font>
<li> Jun 02. Virginia offer accepted.  
</ul>
There are quite a few things to notice about this otherwise-boring
timeline.
<ul>
<li> The spread of dates on the <font color="purple">interview
invitations</font> is wide.  Between the first (Jan 11) and the last (Apr
4) there were almost three entire months. 
<li> <font color="red">Explicit
rejection notices</font> are rare (especially without an interview) and are
rarely early. Many places just never get back to you. 
<li> Many <font color="green">official offers</font> will require answers
before you have heard all of your offers (or, in the case of Purdue for me,
before you have even done half of your interviews). Thus you may be forced
into the uncomfortable position of rejecting a "known good" offer in favor
of only the potential of a better offer later. 
</ul>

<a name="hard"><h3>Hard-Sell Tactics</h3></a>

Official offers will often come with deadlines, especially if you are the
institution's current first choice but they have others "waiting in line"
in case you reject the offer. This can lead to uncomfortable situations
where you have to decide on one offer without knowing about your other
potential offers.  
<p>
Once way to avoid this situation is to schedule all of your interviews in
one massive clump. Sadly, this is basically impossible for two reasons. One
is that your interview offers will trickle in at a varying rate and the
other is that even if all of the dates are available for you, not all of
the dates will be available at every university. The second reason is that
that practical limit is about 2.5 interviews per week and 2 is much more
reasonable. The travel time and the effort of being "on" for the entire
interview are hard to appreciate until you've actually done it. 
<p>
Another way to cope is to ask for more time. If you explain the situation
honestly, many places will push back their deadlines. For example, Purdue
was willing to push their deadline back to effectively May 2 for me.
Unfortunately, that can often still not be long enough (it wasn't for me,
as the timeline indicates). 
<p>
Finally, certain classes of offers rarely come with deadlines. Industrial
research labs (e.g., IBM and Microsoft) can typically afford to sit on an
offer for as long as you would reasonably like once it has been extended to
you. Similarly, some academic offers effectively say "you are our first
choice and there is no one we will extend an offer to this year if you turn
us down, so take as long as you like to think about it." 
<p>
It is my <i>personal opinion</i> (as opposed to the rest of this, but this
bit is really an editorial) that any offer with a deadline that you view as
too restrictive should be rejected. I realize that there are economic
realities and that most offers come with eventual deadlines, but you owe it
to yourself to check out all of your options. In essence, an offer that
says "you're so impressive to us that I want you to come here, get tenure,
and work with us for the rest of your life, but I'm not willing to give you
another two weeks to get all of the relevant information and think about
things" is saying "I don't want you to use you brain or it isn't worth it
to me to let you use you brain, and I think that my best shot at hiring you
involves pressuring you into a situation where you will make a snap
judgment in my favor." Morality and honor typically involve restricting
your actions for some higher goal and often come with a price (e.g.,
deciding not to steal rules out a bunch of actions that could get you more
money, choosing not to lie can make it difficult to explain certain
situations). For me, the price of potentially losing a more lucrative (or
otherwise better-appearing) potential job is one that I am willing to pay
in order to take the "honorable" action of avoiding such hard sell tactics.
In the end, I wouldn't want to work at a place that didn't want me to take
my time and use my mind when considering where to work. 

<a name="talk"<h3>Preparing Your Job Talk</h3></a>

Make sure that you schedule a practice job talk of some sort, if only with
your local research group. Everyone else will be able to give you advice on
it. Make sure that people who are not in your field or office come to your
practice talk. During your actual job talks, in general at most one or two 
other people will be from your field and the rest of the room will be made
up of people from other domains within computer science. The exception to
this is industry: in large industrial research labs, for example, you will 
basically only present to people in your general area. 
<p>
Although the average is "fifty minutes for the talk and ten minutes
for questions", different places will have different time requirements. At
one stop I was asked to fit the entire thing into 50 minutes. At another I
had 75 minutes. Prepare your talk in a modular manner so that you can add
or remove sections as needed. Bonus points if you can do this on the fly --
frequent interruptions are common and can suck up quite a bit of time. At
one venue I actually had audio-visual difficulties (!) delay (and thus
shrink) my talk for ten minutes. 
<p>
There are different opinions on the "one-third one-third one-third"
rule of thumb. A common version suggests that one-third of your talk should
be understood by everyone in the room, one-third should be understood by
people in your general area (e.g., graphics, programming languages,
systems) and one-third should be understood "only by you". 
<p>
The trick here is that your job talk must serve many purposes. It must
convince them that you are a good lecturer (i.e., the talk must be engaging
and speak to your teaching abilities). It will also be their first exposure
to your work (as above, many people will be reading you resume at the
beginning of your interview -- unless you're at a small department, don't
expect anyone beyond your host to know anything about you or your work
unless you say it to them) and must help to convince them that your
research has substance. This point is actually somewhat tricky, because if
they asked you for an interview they probably already believe your work is
good enough (based on you resume, letters, and the local evaluation of the
department members closest to your subfield). 
<p>
I won't describe the general structure or content of a job talk since
they're easily available. The spring before you plan to give your own job
talk, start attending all of the job talks that come to your university.
Take notes on how much introductory material, related work, detailed
material, and future work are presented. Then forget about it for nine
months until you have to craft your own. 
<p>
It is my <i>personal opinion</i> that basically the entire talk should be
understandable to everyone in the room. Motivation is key. Remind people of
why the entire field of programming languages (or whatnot) is worth
considering. A tenured AI professor (as a random example) may well think
that "compilers are a solved problem" and it won't hurt to remind such a
person that there is exciting stuff going on here. Keeping everyone
interested will help to convince them of you teaching potential. In
addition, if people cannot understand your talk they have no way to spot
potential collaborations. My personal job talk was designed to be easily
understood by everyone (it was heavy on motivation, context, analogies and
pictures). I received many comments from people about just how
understandable it was and I also got quite a few offers for collaboration
based on it (e.g., graphics and database people were able to see possible
fits, not just PL people). I also specifically asked people after my talk
if the lack of "Greek letters" or "complicated-looking material" hurt my
case. Typical responses included "it wasn't a problem because were able to
see how intelligently you handled yourself when answering the questions" or
"it was fine because we already know how good your work is" or "no, not at
all." Thus I cannot give you a blanket guarantee that following my approach
won't hurt your employability. I was willing to take that risk to stand up
for something I believed in. I encourage you to consider it carefully.
Finally, the exception here is industrial research (e.g., Microsoft, IBM):
skimp on motivation in such settings -- it will just bore them. It probably
won't count against you (because they explicitly mention that they realize
that no one prepares two job talks and that the intro is appropriate in
academia) but you can possibly earn bonus points by tailoring your talk to
those audiences. 

<a name="visit"><h3>Interview Visits</h3></a>

A typical interview is 1 day or 1.5 days long. You will arrive near dinner
time on day X. Someone may or may not meet you at the airport and may or
may not take you to dinner with one or two others. You sleep and wake up
on day X+1, someone may optionally arrive to take you to breakfast, you
head to the venue, and do the interviews. You first interview is typically
with your host. After that it's random. It is completely legitimate to take
notes the entire time (I did, for example). There's a break for lunch at a
nice restaurant with three or four others, then more interviews. This will
last until around 5pm, at which point they'll take you to dinner (unless
they did it before, but multiple dinner are not uncommon) and then you
sleep.  For a long interview (e.g., IBM research) things continue the next
morning until lunch. You may optionally arrange for the department to set
up a visit with a real-estate agent for you (if you're staying an extra
half-day, for example). Despite the fact that this seems incredibly
presumptuous (since they haven't hired you yet), it's not insulting or
awkward. Even if they don't extend you an offer, getting a feel for that
area will give you a broader basis for comparison when you are considering
you actual offers.  
<p>
Almost all of your time will be spent in offices talking to people
individually. There are really only three main factors that vary between
interview visits. One is the length of each individual interview: anywhere
from 30 minutes to 60 minutes is common. The next is how many individual
interviews you have scheduled. The last is whether your job talk is early
or late. If the talk is later in the day you will have to include a five
minute "elevator" summary of your research at each of your individual
interviews. If the talk is late and the interview slots are thirty minutes,
don't expect to get anything done. If the talk is early you can use that
time to discuss potential collaborations or answer questions they have (and
they will have them!) about your talk. 
<p> 
You will probably have a meeting (or lunch) with the dean (or department
head or upper-level division manager or somesuch). This meeting tends to be
slightly different from all of your other interview chats. At many places
(e.g., Purdue) you will hear about exciting developments and expensive
multi-disciplinary centers being built. Initially this may well sound
irrelevant to you. You should view this sort of thing as a listing of
possible collaborations and sources of funding. You may well receive a copy
of the department's "strategic plan". Other places are of the opinion that
you can either spend your time writing strategic plans or you can spend
your time doing actual work. Ask the dean where the department is going
(invariably the department is growing and going up in the rankings, unless
you're already at MIT or McGill, at which point the department is working
hard to maintain its number-one-in-the-country ranking) and what has
changed in the last few years. Ask the dean to forecast things seven years
into the future (you'll have tenure then). Ask the dean about the hiring
plans for the next few years. If all else fails, ask the dean
about the retirement plan (it shows long term interest and you probably
don't know anything about them yet as a grad student). 
<p>
Separate from the dean interview is the interview with the department chair
(or local hiring manager). This is typically the last interview in the
trip. The chair should suggest that they are still in the middle of their
interview process but that they will have completed all of their interviews
and concluded their deliberations in X days. Get this figure as firmly as
you can and write it down. The chair will also want to know what your
time frame for making decisions is (e.g., when will you be done with
your interviews). Ask why they are hiring. Is it to develop courses? Bring
in students? Do more research? Bring in grant money? Grow the department? 
<p>
When you are emailing back and forth to set up the interview, arrange for a
meeting with grad students. This can be over lunch or in some common
meeting room during one of your slots. Be wary of any academic place that
won't let you meet with grad students (or undergrads if you're at a
college). You'll probably get three or four students at once. Most of the
time the students will be young (first or second year) and won't really
have anything to say. Occasionally they will ask tough questions like "what
will you bring to this department that we don't already have?" or "how does
your research influence your teaching?" or "what courses will you offer
when you first arrive?" or "how will you choose your grad students?". You
should answers to all of these anyway -- don't be like me and get surprised
by them in real-time. Aside from that, you should take the time to ask them
a bunch of questions (see below).
<p>
Formal attire is absolutely not required at CS interviews. I did all of
mine in khakis, hiking boots and a black faux-turtleneck shirt (if you're
trying to picture this in your mind, it's the outfit I wear all the time
anyway). Actually, the airline lost my luggage once so I did one of my
interviews in yesterday's travel jeans and t-shirt. They specifically
mentioned that it didn't count against me. One place mentioned that you can
lose points for wearing a suit and tie (you look stuffy). On the other hand,
Doctors Liblit and Gulwani wore formal clothing and got great jobs.
Conclusion: it doesn't matter what you wear, so wear what makes you the
most comfortable. If you do want to wear a suit of some kind, practice
giving talks and sitting around in it before your interviews. On a personal
note, if (say) the airline has lost your luggage including your electric
razor and you've never shaved with a blade, don't try to learn with the
free one provided by the hotel just before your interview. Trust me. 
<p> 
It is basically impossible to communicate in advance how tiring the
interview process is. Flying every other day (especially from coast to
coast) is exhausting. Plus you'll lose an hour taking the BART to the
airport and then getting the rental car and whatnot. With time zone shifts
you'll never really be able to get a good meal in transit (except for the
ones they take you to) so you'll be eating too much airport food. Pack some
snacks. Beyond that, though, being "on" for a day and a half can be
draining. Aside from these interviews it's rare to spend nine hours (!)
consecutively talking to people about complicated topics, knowing that your
future employment is on the line. You must smile and be friendly and in a
good humor the whole time. It's not difficult but it does take more energy
than you think. Talking to professors you don't know for a nine hours is
not like talking to your friends for nine hours. Consider taking Dramamine
or sleeping pills or somesuch just to ensure that you get some rest on the
plane. 

<A name="questions"><h3>Interview Questions</h3></a>

The majority of the interview is made up of one-on-one sessions between you
an an elder researcher you've never met before. Expect the worst-case
scenario: you will have to fill the entire 45 minutes yourself by asking
questions. Here are some questions (and follow-ups) I asked (and, where
applicable, the canonical cross-institution answer). 
<ul>
<li> What's the funding situation like here? Have you had good luck with
grants recently? When you were a new faculty member did you get much help
with grant-writing? 
<li> Everyone has only great things to say about this place. What's your
least favorite part about working here? 
<li> What can you tell me about the quality of the graduate students here?
How did you go about picking your first few grad students? I've heard
rumors that a bad grad student can be a big drain on a new professor -- how
do you avoid that? 
  <ul>
  <li> Answer: The average graduate student here isn't as good as the
  average graduate student at Berkeley, so you can't always just take one
  from the pool and be assured of getting a winner. However, the best grad
  students here are just as good as the best ones anywhere else -- it's
  just that the tail of the distribution is longer. 
  </ul>
<li> How important is technology transfer or working with the product
divisions? What's the funding model here? What happens if I pick something
to work on and no one in development seems to like it? How do I go about
making contacts with developers? How much academic freedom is there? 
<li> What's the tenure process like here? Can I suggest my own
letter-writers? Are there mid-point reviews? Is there a "magic formula"?
How many people have failed to get tenure in the last 10 to 15 years? 
  <ul>
  <li> Research Answer: There's no magic formula. Teaching, research and
  service are all important. Officially you must be stupendous at two of
  the three and fair at one. However, you can't really pick research (or
  teaching) as the one to be bad at. Teaching can only hurt you -- we will
  look at your numerical teaching evaluations and if they are below a
  cut-off you fail to get tenure. Otherwise we ignore teaching. The amount
  of grant money you bring in may or may not be a tenure consideration. We
  care about paper and venue quality, not quantity. One or two journal
  papers helps. Before going up for tenure you should teach at least one
  undergrad class. 
  </ul>
<li> Friends of mine who are professors at other universities have had to
hide their teaching awards when they went up for tenure. The subtext was
that if you had that much time to be spending on teaching you should have
spent it on research. What are things like here? 
<li> What's the teaching load? Does it change after you get tenure? Can you
"buy out" of a class? What does that cost? Who decides what you teach? 
<li> What's it like being a new single/married faculty member here? How did
you make friends when you first came to the area? Was it easy to find
things to do? 
<li> Are the faculty young or old? Is the university structured and
hierarchical? Do decisions come down from on high? How much power do young
faculty members have? 
<li> What's it like to live here? How long is your commute? 
<li> What's the worst example of office politics you've run into here? What
do people fight over?
  <ul>
  <li> Answer: We're very collegial. We don't really have office politics.
  No one gets mad at anyone else. We sometimes squabble over space.
  </ul>
<li> What's the general view on programming languages (or whatever) here?
Is it a second-class citizen? Is theory emphasized? Practice? Building big
systems? 
</ul>

Questions they may ask you:
<ul>
<li> <b>Tell me how your interests are aligned with some of the faculty here.
Who could you work with? </b>
  <ul>
  <li> This was by far the most common question. I encourage you to write
  down in some obvious place (e.g., at the top of your notebook) the name
  of anyone you think you could collaborate with so that you can answer
  this question intelligently. 
  </ul>
<li> <b>Are you married? Do you have a two-body problem?</b>
  <ul>
  <li> This question is nominally "illegal" but everyone will ask it
  anyway (even though you have put the answer explicitly on the front of
  you resume). Just deal with it. I have at least two data points of people
  being put in very awkward positions here (one was loosely "we have a lot
  of great women on campus and if you can't find someone within a few years
  there's something wrong with you" and the other was loosely "what's you
  religion and sexual orientation?"). Have a nice way to back out of such
  conversational cul-de-sacs. If you are asked anything more intrusive than
  "are you married?" feel free to mention it to your host. It's better to
  point this out to someone who likes you than to have the evil
  questioner's possibly negative opinion of you hurt you chances. 
  </ul>
<li> What will your CAREER award be about? 
<li> What will your first student's Ph.D. topic be (in general)? How many
students do you plan to have? 
<li> What courses would you be willing to teach? Are you interested in
creating new courses? 
<li> How will you divide your time between research, teaching and service? 
<li> What sort of research will you be doing in the future? 
  <ul>
  <li> Nominally your job talk will have addressed this, but they may ask
  again in a more general sense -- do you think you'll be in programming
  languages (for example) forever, or do you see yourself shifting to
  systems or graphics? Take this opportunity to distance yourself from your
  advisor if need be -- you want to argue that you can pursue your own work
  for tenure. 
  </ul>
<li> Where do you get most of your funding? NSF? Other government agencies?
Corporate funding? 
</ul>

I typically used up almost all of the time asking questions of the other
person. Remember, you are there to interview them as well. 

<a name="salary"><h3>Salary Negotiations</h3></a>

At some point someone will make you an official offer. This will include
your nine-month salary and a startup package. The startup package should
include money for graduate students (two students for two years each is
typical), travel and equipment. It should also include discretionary funds. 
Your initial contract will probably be for three years, at which point they
will evaluate things and then re-hire you, and then a few years later you
go up for tenure. 
<p>
Everyone knows everyone else and what the going rate is, so if you don't do
anything about it all of your offers from the same job category will be
quite similar. Thus, haggling. 
<p>
The first thing to note is that haggling is controversial and unsettling.
Some people believe that you should just do good work for the good money
they offer you and not become known as one of those grasping department
members who always has to have more than everyone else. In general,
salary negotiations do not take place because graduate students
have no experience with haggling and find the process uncomfortable.
Talking so bluntly about money and putting yourself forward to get more of
it can be distasteful. Since your new salary will be four or five times
what you are making as a grad student, it may seem like it's not worth
making yourself uncomfortable to get another thousand or two. 
<p>
The trick here is that almost all of your raises will be cumulative and
percentage-based. By the laws of compound interest your starting salary
becomes critically important. Especially since you're going to be there for
at least twenty years. With one exception, everyone I talked to was in
favor of haggling for your starting salary. Responses were either "I
didn't do it and now I regret it" or "I did it and it didn't work, but you
should try it" or "I did it and it worked and I'm glad". The common
consensus seems to be that you owe it to your family and future kids and
mortgages to try to get paid what you are worth. 
<p>
OK, now that we've decided that selfishness is a virtue (sorry, couldn't
resist), how do we go about haggling? 
<p>
The first thing to note is that although you will be conducting this
process with the department chair (or hiring manager or whatnot) who sent
you the official offer, <i>it doesn't hurt them and they are not really
involved</i>. If you ask for $5k you're not taking $5k out of the chair's
salary or even the chair's budget. The chair will go to the dean and convey
your request (and typically argue for it). The dean will come back with
something and the chair will relay that you. Do not adopt a zero-sum
mentality here -- you'll hamstring yourself. In industry the situation is
even more clear-cut -- you're not negotiating with your manager, you're
often negotiating with someone in HR or Accounting or somesuch. 
<p>
Anyway, so they've given you an offer with a starting salary of X. How do
you ask more without just saying "give me more money"? There are two
traditional approaches. 
<ul>
  <li> One approach works by comparison. If you already have a higher offer
  they will probably match it (this isn't a guarantee -- my UMass offer was
  not matched by NYU, for example, and if the schools are far apart in
  rankings they may not play this game). You may well have to send them a
  copy of the other offer to show the dean. This is the easiest approach.
  Basically, you say that you would really like to work here but that you
  have a higher offer from another comparable place. Can they match it?
  They'll get right on it. 
  <li> The other approach is just ask for more money. Mention that you
  think the salary is low or that the cost of living there is high or that
  (you'll never do this, but hey) you're a strong researcher with a
  promising research career coming from Berkeley with a
  better-than-respectable resume and that you think you're worth a bit
  more. 
</ul>
Regardless, you never want to turn things into an "or-else" or "ultimatum"
situation. Phrasing is key: "your offer is not the most attractive offer
available to me" rather than "give me more or I'm leaving." The fact that
they made you an offer means that they want you. They are sort of on your
side even though they are negotiating. It's also valid to ask to what
extent the salary is negotiable. In many places (e.g., Berkeley, Microsoft)
you obtain permission to hire someone at a certain "level" or "rank" or
"band" and that strictly limits the starting salary range to within two or
three thousand dollars. 
<p>
It may be difficult to adjust your starting salary but you'll probably find
it easier to change your startup package. You can try to ask for more
students, more discretionary funding, or for the entire startup package to
be discretionary (e.g., "I will be able to live with the amount of money
you're offering me if you allow me to spend it any way I like"). 
<p>
By some combination of these approaches (considering and comparing across
all offers) I was able to increase my (lowest) starting salary by 3.6% and
double my (lowest) startup funds. 
<p>
You can expect industrial salaries to be 12/9ths of a nine-month academic
salary. However, raises in industry are much more common. For example, a
friend of mine has gotten a 10% raise every year for the last five or six
years. Industry raises range between 0% and 15% yearly. You also get
bonuses in industry. 
<p>
Company trivia: Friends of mine at IBM have suggested that on a starting
salary offer of $110,000 you should ask for another $10,000 right off the
bat (and that they'll do it without blinking an eye). If for some
reason you can't bring yourself to do that that it would be "criminal" not
to ask for $5,000. However, multiple data points at Microsoft Research
suggest that it is very difficult to haggle for starting salaries there
because of internal strictures. I only know of one success story haggling
at Microsoft. 
<p>
Find out when your startup funds expire. In addition, make sure (in
writing) that your grad student funding includes the summer months. A
friend ended up in a situation where he "took their word" that it extended
to include the summer and they came back to him later and made a fuss
because it wasn't written in the contract. 
<p>
Finally, if you think you want to haggle but you need more advice about it,
email your local department head (or past department heads). They have
probably seen it many times from both sides of the fence and are often
willing to give advice (it worked for me). 

<A name="reject"><h3>Dealing With Rejection</h3></a>

After you have had an interview with a place there are basically only two
reasons for them to reject you. 
<ul>
<li> One is that they "couldn't build a consensus". Variants on this phrase
are common. Since you'll be there for a long time (e.g., with tenure) it's
important that everyone get along. Thus if one or two people argue against
you, your odds of getting a job there are low. However, since you were
offered an interview there were at least a few people who liked you, so
rather than being able to say "everyone hated you" they will say "we
couldn't form a strong consensus". 
<li> Another possibility is that you were their second or third choice ("in
line") and that the first person they offered the job to accepted it. 
</ul>
You should tread carefully in the time period after your interviews but
before your official offers. Many department chairs have told me that they
view it as part of their job (or their responsibility to the department) to 
put the brightest face on this possible and essentially to "string you
along" or "never say no" (and thus keep as many good options for the
department open as possible). Thus a department chair saying "we're still
deliberating" may well mean "we've made a job offer to someone else already
and we're waiting to see how that goes". It has been suggested that
grad students who are naive about the interview process will interpret
"we'll get back to you in a week or two" the wrong way and may thus end up
waiting too long for a job offer that never arrives. In such a case you
should talk to your host or other department members in your area to get 
the inside scoop. 
<p>
It is my <b>personal opinion (and experience)</b> that this isn't really
the case. All of the places that said to me variants of "we're still
interviewing candidates and we'll have our faculty meeting to decide in 2
weeks" ended up making me an offer in 2 weeks -- it wasn't some sort of
smokescreen. Similarly, places that didn't think they were going to be able
to make me an offer (e.g. McGill) told me the rumor early (e.g., "we're
having trouble building consensus, I can't give you any reason to wait for
us") when I asked -- long before they sent an official reject letter. 
This is another case where being more or honorable can cost you job offers.
I was willing to deal with people in good faith and assume that they were
not lying to me when they said they would get back to me later. For me it
turned out that they were not lying, but I was willing to take the risk
that they were (and thus that I would wait too long for something that
would never materialize and lose my good offers along the way).  A place
that mentions that they play the "positive spin, never say no" game may
well be dealing intelligently with a harsh economic reality, but you may
not want to work there (cf. office politics). 

<a name="decide"><h3>Deciding</h3></a>

Talk to everyone. Don't forget to consult yourself. I can't really help you
here generically. 

<a name="trivia"><h3>Trivia</h3></a>

Here are some random things that didn't fit in elsewhere. 
<ul>
<li>
In 2005 Purdue got 380 applicants for 3 job spots in CS and held 14
interviews. In programming languages alone they got 20 applicants and held
6-7 interviews for one spot. In 2005 Virginia got 457 applicants for 4
faculty positions. 
<li>
If you're having a hard time deciding, it's quite legitimate to go on a
second visit (or two). 
<li> 
Read the <a href="http://www.cra.org/statistics/">CRA Taulbee survey</a>. 
<li>
Many people will tell you that if all else fails, use rankings to break
ties. Better ranked schools will have better grad students and will find it
easier to get grant money. One problem with this is that different people
remember the rankings differently. Whenever you ask someone for advice, ask
for a relative ranking of your schools. You'll be surprised at how many
complete inversions you receive. 
<li> 
A personal recommendation or inside champion can be a great boost and can
help in case of a tie. If you are trying to end up at school X and you know
someone at Y who is friend with someone at X, having Y them briefly mention
you positively to X won't hurt you. 
<li>
Before the interview you should go over everyone on the faculty web page
and find people with research interests similar to your own. Learn the
names of their projects (at least!). 
<li>
Do not expect to accomplish any work (beyond giving a conference talk)
between February and May. 
<li>
This is version 1 of this document. I don't particularly forsee other
versions, but you never know. Every time I release something without a
version system it comes back to haunt me.
