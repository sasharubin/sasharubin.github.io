\section{\mysidestyle {Research}}

I work in formal methods, a branch of theoretical computer science, and study the power of automata theory (broadly construed) and mathematical logic for describing, reasoning and controlling systems.

\item[Accomplishments]\

%list  their  five  most  important publications since their last review, along with brief explanations  of  why  each  paper  is  significant.

During my PhD I (and my co-authors) pioneered the development of the theory of automatic structures. My most cited publications in this area are:
\cite{DBLP:conf/lics/KhoussainovNRS04} (\citeKNRS04\ citations; all citation counts are as reported by Google Scholar) and 
\cite{DBLP:journals/bsl/Rubin08} (\citeRubin08\ citations). My PhD thesis (\citeThesis\ citations) was awarded  the Vice-chancellor's prize for the best doctoral thesis in the Faculty of Science, and Montgomery memorial prize in logic from the Department of Philosophy. 

I was then awarded a prestigious New Zealand Science and Technology Postdoctoral Fellowship. During this fellowship, I published a survey and extension of the main results in my thesis in the Bulletin of Symbolic Logic \cite{DBLP:journals/bsl/Rubin08}, and I (with a PhD student of Erich Gr\"adel's) solved a 12 year-old conjecture of Courcelle's \cite{DBLP:conf/stacs/GanzowR08}.

In the last few years, I (with my co-authors) generalised a cornerstone paper on verification of parameterised systems ("Reasoning about Rings", E.A. Emerson, K.S. Namjoshi, {\sc POPL}, 1995) from ring topologies to arbitrary topologies (\citeAminofJKR14\ citations) \cite{DBLP:conf/vmcai/AminofJKR14}. We also completed a book, published by Morgan \& Claypool, surveying decidability results in parameterised verification \cite{DBLP:series/synthesis/2015Bloem}.

Recently, I was awarded a two year Marie-Curie fellowship from the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica to work on formal methods for parameterised light-weight mobile agents. I opened this direction with \cite{DBLP:conf/atal/Rubin15}.  Subsequently (with my co-authors) I continued this direction and published in top rated conferences \cite{DBLP:conf/prima/RubinZMA15,DBLP:conf/atal/AminofMRZ16} and won a best-paper award \cite{DBLP:conf/prima/MuranoPR15} (invited to {\sc JAAMAS}.)

\section{\mysidestyle{Teaching and Supervision}}

%\section{\mysidestyle{Undergraduate Teaching philosophy}}

I have a passion for teaching, and a proactive approach to learning best-practices.
I spent 1.5 years teaching undergraduate calculus at Cornell. I sought out a number of teaching mentors, including Maria Terrell (Department of Mathematics) and David Way (associate director of the Cornell University Centre for Teaching Excellence) to discuss successful teaching strategies, both philosophical and concrete. As a result, according to my student evaluations, I was clear, organised, proactively willing to help, and motivating.

I have a strong record of undergraduate supervision. While at Cornell I mentored six students for three months in a research programme. This resulted in two publications \cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/GrinshpunPRT14,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1210-2462} and gave students a taste of research to help them decide if they should pursue a PhD. While at IST Austria I co-mentored one intern which resulted in \cite{DBLP:conf/lata/ChatterjeeCR13}. 
While in Naples, I worked closely with two PhD students, resulting in \cite{DBLP:conf/atal/AminofMMR16,AMMR16-SR,GMRS16IJCAI}.\\

%My goal as a teacher of undergraduate courses is to guide students through the material (eg. I point out which ideas are fundamental and which are technicalities), show students how the material is relevant to their degree, and help students think deeply.  I regularly self-evaluate and engage colleagues in order to discover good teaching principles.
%% (eg. is there a better way of breaking the material into chunks to help students follow?).
%%and engage colleagues in discussions
%% in order to improve my presentation %of the material, 
%I employ questions which encourage students to express themselves clearly and internalise the material, eg. `can anyone help A with her answer?', `can you explain B's idea to me?', `what do you mean by X?', `are you sure?'.
%Another technique I have used is administering an easy online quiz that requires students to read the relevant section of the textbook before coming to class; as a result students ask deeper questions than they otherwise would, a sign that they are better prepared to understand the material discussed in class.
%%,   `who will summarise today's class?'.
%%,  `if all I do is teach you skills I'm short-changing you'.
