\section{Notes}

Here are some other basic facts about $\LEX(\LTL,\mp)$-games that we should include.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item NE need not exist (matching pennies).
 \item Even if NE exist, they need not be positional. This is already true for mean-payoff games, cf.~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1210-3539}.
 \item Mixed NE need not exist. Moreover, it is undecidable if there exists a mixed NE (already holds for mean-payoff).
\end{enumerate}

- positional strategies are strategies in which the suggested action only depends on the current state, not on the history

- finite-state strategies are strategies that can be implemented by finite-state transducers.
