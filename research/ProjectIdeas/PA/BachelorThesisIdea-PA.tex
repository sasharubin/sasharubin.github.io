\section*{Solving public-action games}



The aim of this project is to build a tool that solves multiplayer public-action games,
and test on card-game scenarios.

%(each player lives on a node of a graph and has a fixed finite number of actions, and whose payoff, at each step, depends on the actions of its neighbours).

\subsection*{Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
\item READ: CGS, ATLK\footnote{\url{http://krak.ipipan.waw.pl/~wjamroga/papers/jamroga15specifmas.pdf}}, solving public-action games\footnote{\url{http://people.na.infn.it/~murano/pubblicazioni/main-ATL-broad.pdf}}
\item WRITE: Algorithm for solving two-player public-action games with epistemic reachability objectives.
% - sketch algorithm for synthesis that uses solving 2-player safety/reachability game and not tree-automata emptiness.
\item CODE: Algorithm using libraries for DFW manipulation and game solving.
\item CODE: Modeling language for representing arenas (MCMAS?) 
\item EVALUATE: on card-game scenarios.
\item WRITEUP
\end{enumerate}
