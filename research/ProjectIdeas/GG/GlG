GlG
- more care should be spent on precisely defining the utility function
which are realistic.
- meaningful agents! e.g., agreeing on specific actions.
- no other work in the literature uses this function, because all others are more general.
- weighted boolean logic.

!!issue of payoff function is OPEN!!
i.e., define payoff in formal ways. algebraic approach. 
vary utility function.

e.g., F:A \to N(eg true = 1, false = 0). Aggregate these weights (sum of weights), 
then compare to my weight. monotone, convex functions. algebraic properties.

we miss a concrete study of complexity varying payoff functions.
taxonomy of payoff function, related to KR! e.g., abstract MAX, what do we mean by payoff function.
e.g., sum/max/averg of actions of nbrs. algebraic characterisation.


1. identify specific utility functions which fit in the framework which do not have proofs (not studied in literature).
parametric utility function... phase transition!

2. also study polynomial cases on real social environments. identify real restriction on the utility function (facebook, twitter).

3. nash DYNAMICS. spread of opinion. convergences. see preliminary work in this paper. how long it will take for the network to 
be nearly stable. does "asynchr do best response" converge to a NE? does it converge? how fast?
one agent deviates
many agents deviate - twitter, facebook. can one predict.
all possible agents deviate

is the network almost stable? e.g., 90% happy.
if i wait 10 actions, how many agents will end up being happy?
